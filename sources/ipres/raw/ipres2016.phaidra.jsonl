We examine at a practical level what is involved in migrating to or from a cloud-hosted service, either to bring preservation in-house or to move to another service provider.

Contractual agreements, data escrow, open source software licensing, use of independent third-party providers, and tested processes and procedures all come into play. These are necessary to mitigate the risks of a wide range of scenarios including vendor failure, service unavailability, change in customer preservation scale or budgets, and migration to or from an in-house approach. There is an existing body of work on how to trust and measure a service that a vendor might offer, for example using audit criteria for Trusted Digital Repositories or measuring service maturity using NDSA preservation levels. However, there has been far less work on how to quickly and safely exit providers of such services - despite this being an essential part of business continuity and disaster recovery. This poster presents some of the considerations and the practical approach taken by Arkivum to this problem including: use of open source software (Archivematica, and ownCloud), data escrow, contracts and handovers, use of vendor independent standards and interfaces (PREMIS, METS, Bagit) and technical migration support, e.g. exports of databases, configurations, software versions and updates.

However, little is known about the total amounts, characteristics, and sustainability of data that could be used for these purposes. The Stewardship Gap is an 18-month project funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to understand issues in defining metrics for and measuring the stewardship gap: the potential gap between the amount of valuable data produced through sponsored projects in the United States and the amount that is effectively stewarded and made accessible. This paper reports on the first phase of the project, which sought to develop an instrument to gather information about research data sustainability from a broad variety of researchers and research disciplines and make progress toward the ultimate goals of 1) shedding light on the size, characteristics, and sustainability of valuable sponsored research data and creative work in the United States, and 2) recommending actions stakeholders can take to address the stewardship gap if one is found to exist."], "dc_format": ["application/pdf"], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.503172", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:503172"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_publisher": [" Swiss National Library, Bern"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/at/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/at/"], "dc_title": ["Will Today\u2019s Data Be Here Tomorrow?
