The paper then proceeds to describe the DIP format before detailing what the access solution will look like, which tools will be developed and, not least, why the E-ARK Access system will be used and work."], "dc_format": ["application/pdf"], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.429561", "ISBN: 978-0-692-59881-8", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:429561"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_publisher": ["School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"], "dc_source": ["Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Digital Preservation"], "dc_subject_eng": ["Access management, DIP format, E-ARK-project, digital archives", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2015 (001010)"], "keyword_suggest": ["Access management, DIP format, E-ARK-project, digital archives", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2015 (001010)"], "dc_title": ["Towards a Common Approach for Access to Digital Archival Records in Europe"], "dc_title_eng": ["Towards a Common Approach for Access to Digital Archival Records in Europe"], "dc_type_eng": ["Text"], "modified": "2017-03-01T05:00:33.043Z", "owner": "leec92", "pid": "o:429561", "resourcetype": "text", "size": 756361.0, "title_suggest": ["Towards a Common Approach for Access to Digital Archival Records in Europe", "Towards a Common Approach for Access to Digital Archival Records in Europe"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Alex\",\"lastname\":\"Thirifays\"},{\"data_order\":\"1\",\"firstname\":\"Katherine\",\"lastname\":\"Hougaard Edsen Johansen\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2016-03-04T14:01:11.493Z"], "_version_": 1760545637934301184, "ispartof": ["o:168770", "o:424738", "o:429627"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "Towards a Common Approach for Access to Digital Archival Records in Europe", "sort_dc_title": "Towards a Common Approach for Access to Digital Archival Records in Europe", "tsize": [756361.0], "tmodified": ["2017-03-01T05:00:33.043Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:429627", "__source_name": "ipres2015", "__year": 2015}

Another suggested approach is more silo oriented, based on harvests of web pages referred to by webpages within a National Top Level Domain."], "dc_format": ["application/pdf"], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.429612", "ISBN: 978-0-692-59881-8", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:429612"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_publisher": ["School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"], "dc_source": ["Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Digital Preservation"], "dc_subject_eng": ["digital preservation, digital curation, iPRES, Chapel Hill", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2015 (001010)"], "keyword_suggest": ["digital preservation, digital curation, iPRES, Chapel Hill", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2015 (001010)"], "dc_title": ["Automatic Identification and Preservation of National Parts of the Internet Outside a Country\u2019s Top Level Domain"], "dc_title_eng": ["Automatic Identification and Preservation of National Parts of the Internet Outside a Country\u2019s Top Level Domain"], "dc_type_eng": ["Text"], "modified": "2017-03-01T04:57:01.950Z", "owner": "leec92", "pid": "o:429612", "resourcetype": "text", "size": 355512.0, "title_suggest": ["Automatic Identification and Preservation of National Parts of the Internet Outside a Country\u2019s Top Level Domain", "Automatic Identification and Preservation of National Parts of the Internet Outside a Country\u2019s Top Level Domain"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Eld\",\"lastname\":\"Zierau\"}],\"role\":\"edt\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2016-03-05T11:57:51.172Z"], "_version_": 1760545586550931456, "ispartof": ["o:168770", "o:424738", "o:429627"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "Automatic Identification and Preservation of National Parts of the Internet Outside a Country\u2019s Top Level Domain", "sort_dc_title": "Automatic Identification and Preservation of National Parts of the Internet Outside a Country\u2019s Top Level Domain", "tsize": [355512.0], "tmodified": ["2017-03-01T04:57:01.950Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:429627", "__source_name": "ipres2015", "__year": 2015}

The goal of the poster is to highlight the self-organizing nature of the S&P\u2019s varied projects as well as to increase community awareness of the collaboratively developed resources and products."], "dc_format": ["application/pdf"], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.429577", "ISBN: 978-0-692-59881-8", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:429577"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_publisher": ["School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"], "dc_source": ["Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Digital Preservation"], "dc_subject_eng": ["Best Practices, Community, Collaboration, Education, Standards, Survey", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2015 (001010)"], "keyword_suggest": ["Best Practices, Community, Collaboration, Education, Standards, Survey", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2015 (001010)"], "dc_title": ["In the Thicket of It with the NDSA Standards and Practices Working Group: Cultivating Grass Roots Approaches to Real-World Digital Preservation Issues"], "dc_title_eng": ["In the Thicket of It with the NDSA Standards and Practices Working Group: Cultivating Grass Roots Approaches to Real-World Digital Preservation Issues"], "dc_type_eng": ["Text"], "modified": "2017-03-01T04:59:34.897Z", "owner": "leec92", "pid": "o:429577", "resourcetype": "text", "size": 452440.0, "title_suggest": ["In the Thicket of It with the NDSA Standards and Practices Working Group: Cultivating Grass Roots Approaches to Real-World Digital Preservation Issues", "In the Thicket of It with the NDSA Standards and Practices Working Group: Cultivating Grass Roots Approaches to Real-World Digital Preservation Issues"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Winston\",\"lastname\":\"Atkins\"},{\"data_order\":\"1\",\"firstname\":\"Erin\",\"lastname\":\"Engle\"},{\"data_order\":\"2\",\"firstname\":\"Andrea\",\"lastname\":\"Goethals\"},{\"data_order\":\"3\",\"firstname\":\"Karl\",\"lastname\":\"Jackson\"},{\"data_order\":\"4\",\"firstname\":\"Carol\",\"lastname\":\"Kussmann\"},{\"data_order\":\"5\",\"firstname\":\"Kate\",\"lastname\":\"Murray\"},{\"data_order\":\"6\",\"firstname\":\"Michelle\",\"lastname\":\"Paolillo\"},{\"data_order\":\"7\",\"firstname\":\"Mariella\",\"lastname\":\"Soprano\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2016-03-04T15:36:58.067Z"], "_version_": 1760545631449907200, "ispartof": ["o:168770", "o:424738", "o:429627"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "In the Thicket of It with the NDSA Standards and Practices Working Group: Cultivating Grass Roots Approaches to Real-World Digital Preservation Issues", "sort_dc_title": "In the Thicket of It with the NDSA Standards and Practices Working Group: Cultivating Grass Roots Approaches to Real-World Digital Preservation Issues", "tsize": [452440.0], "tmodified": ["2017-03-01T04:59:34.897Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:429627", "__source_name": "ipres2015", "__year": 2015}
