The modifications enable a more thorough analysis of object structures, accentuate the differences and similarities between the framework\u2019s two streams of analysis (i.e. Object and Stakeholder analysis) and, subsequently, improve the final reformulation of the properties. To demonstrate the applicability of the modified framework, the paper presents a use case of a blog preservation initiative that is informed by stakeholder interviews and evaluation of structural and technological foundations of blogs.

Each of this is presumably an encoding of the \u201csame data\u201d. We explore three approaches to formalization into first order logic and for each we identify distinctive tradeoffs for preservation models. Our analysis further motivates the development of a system that will provide a comprehensive treatment of data concepts.

In order to assess the authenticity and the provenance of the records, one must be able to trace back, along the whole extent of their lifecycle since their creation, all the relevant events and transformations they have undergone and that may have affected their authenticity and provenance and collect the Preservation Description Information (PDI) as categorized by OAIS. This paper presents a model and a set of operational guidelines to collect and manage the authenticity evidence to properly document these transformations, that have been developed within the APARSEN project, a EU funded NoE, as an implementation of the InterPARES conceptual framework and of the CASPAR methodology. Moreover we discuss the implementation of the guidelines in a medical environment, the health care preservation repository in Vicenza Italy, where digital resources have a quite complex lifecycle including several changes of custody, aggregations and format migrations. The case study has proved the robustness of the methodology, which stands as a concrete proposal for a systematic and operational way to deal with the problem of authenticity management in complex environments.
