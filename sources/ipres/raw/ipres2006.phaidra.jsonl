The mission of the SNL and the Swiss Cantonal libraries is to collect and archive all Swiss publications, both printed and electronic. The objective of the e-Helvetica Project is to fulfill this mission for electronic publications. The Web Archive Switzerland pilot project recently designed and tested a shared workflow for selecting, collecting, cataloguing, archiving and disseminating non-commercial Swiss web resources. Within the workflow the Cantonal libraries are responsible for the identification, selection and announcement of data on the Web. The SNL is responsible for the web-harvesting (objects and rights), cataloguing, archiving and dissemination of those identified web resources. The aim of this co-operation is to share resources and knowledge. This presentation will give some historical context to Web Archive Switzerland and discuss the collaboration with the Cantonal libraries and the shared workflow. The approach chosen for selecting, cataloguing and harvesting the web resources will be highlighted as well as our experiences to date. The presentation will conclude with some ideas on how we are planning to disseminate the web resources.

The mission of the SNL and the Swiss Cantonal libraries is to collect and archive all Swiss publications, both printed and electronic. The objective of the e-Helvetica Project is to fulfill this mission for electronic publications. The Web Archive Switzerland pilot project recently designed and tested a shared workflow for selecting, collecting, cataloguing, archiving and disseminating non-commercial Swiss web resources. Within the workflow the Cantonal libraries are responsible for the identification, selection and announcement of data on the Web. The SNL is responsible for the web-harvesting (objects and rights), cataloguing, archiving and dissemination of those identified web resources. The aim of this co-operation is to share resources and knowledge. This presentation will give some historical context to Web Archive Switzerland and discuss the collaboration with the Cantonal libraries and the shared workflow.

In this presentation we discuss the policy and ambitions of the National Library of the Netherlands (Koninklijke Bibliotheek, KB) regarding digital archiving of electronic publications. We discuss three possible threats against permanent access, and we propose a coordinated and systematic approach to address these risks: the Safe Places Network. This paper also includes a comprehensive overview of the e-Depot system and the KB approaches to digital preservation."], "dc_format": ["application/pdf"], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.294560", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294560"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY-SA 3.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/at/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY-SA 3.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/at/"], "dc_subject_eng": ["iPRES, Ithaca", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2006 (001001)"], "keyword_suggest": ["iPRES, Ithaca", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2006 (001001)"], "dc_title": ["The International e-Depot: e-Journal Archiving at the national library of the Netherlands: Presentation - iPRES 2006 - Ithaca"], "dc_title_eng": ["The International e-Depot: e-Journal Archiving at the national library of the Netherlands: Presentation - iPRES 2006 - Ithaca"], "dc_type_eng": ["Text"], "modified": "2017-03-02T02:26:31.654Z", "owner": "kellerc2", "pid": "o:294560", "resourcetype": "text", "size": 197013.0, "title_suggest": ["The International e-Depot: e-Journal Archiving at the national library of the Netherlands: Presentation - iPRES 2006 - Ithaca", "The International e-Depot: e-Journal Archiving at the national library of the Netherlands: Presentation - iPRES 2006 - Ithaca"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Erik\",\"lastname\":\"Oltmans\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2013-07-04T12:34:06.043Z"], "_version_": 1761117123290071040, "ispartof": ["o:168770", "o:294903", "o:424738"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "The International e-Depot: e-Journal Archiving at the national library of the Netherlands: Presentation - iPRES 2006 - Ithaca", "sort_dc_title": "The International e-Depot: e-Journal Archiving at the national library of the Netherlands: Presentation - iPRES 2006 - Ithaca", "tsize": [197013.0], "tmodified": ["2017-03-02T02:26:31.654Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:294903", "__source_name": "iPRES", "__year": 2006}

Since 2003 we have been running DSpace repository software in the School of Information, University of Texas at Austin, at first simply as a testbed for student work but since spring of 2005 as an institutional archival repository. In the course of this experience, following the \u201cseed-evolve-reseed\u201d model developed by Gerhard Fischer at the University of Colorado for collaborative development of computing environments, we have begun to demonstrate the value of such a repository in several different directions: fulfilling the state of Texas statutory requirements for preserving official documents (in which the official version of administrative information is posted on the School\u2019s website); providing faculty (and students) with preprint and postprint exposure of their work; providing secure storage for learning objects, including presentations and tutorials; providing secure archiving for digital materials of historical value both to the School and to the discipline; providing an environment for students to work on the problems of digital archiving, populated with objects that will over time and in their turn demonstrate further problems of digital archiving; and providing the Information Technology service with a secure archive for versions of installed software and content.

Historically, preservation of the tangible materials has been handled in collaboration with the individual libraries participating in the Federal Depository Library Program. Advances in information dissemination and the need to preserve digital content has necessitated changes in processes associated with GPO's production and distribution of Federal publications. Working with U.S. Government agencies, depository libraries and other interested parties, GPO is moving to implement a life-cycle approach to publishing of Federal publications to ensure not only access, but preservation of the objects for the future. This presentation will focus on GPO's collaboration with other communities of practice and the development of FDsys, GPO's digital content management system."], "dc_format": ["application/pdf"], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.294558", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294558"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY-SA 3.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/at/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY-SA 3.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/at/"], "dc_subject_eng": ["iPRES, Ithaca", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2006 (001001)"], "keyword_suggest": ["iPRES, Ithaca", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2006 (001001)"], "dc_title": ["Preservation of Federal Digital Publications: GPO, Federal Depository Libraries, and Other Federal Agencies: Presentation - iPRES 2006 - Ithaca"], "dc_title_eng": ["Preservation of Federal Digital Publications: GPO, Federal Depository Libraries, and Other Federal Agencies: Presentation - iPRES 2006 - Ithaca"], "dc_type_eng": ["Text"], "modified": "2017-03-02T02:26:43.849Z", "owner": "kellerc2", "pid": "o:294558", "resourcetype": "text", "size": 135115.0, "title_suggest": ["Preservation of Federal Digital Publications: GPO, Federal Depository Libraries, and Other Federal Agencies: Presentation - iPRES 2006 - Ithaca", "Preservation of Federal Digital Publications: GPO, Federal Depository Libraries, and Other Federal Agencies: Presentation - iPRES 2006 - Ithaca"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Robin\",\"lastname\":\"Haun-Mohamed\"},{\"data_order\":\"1\",\"firstname\":\"Gil\",\"lastname\":\"Baldwin\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2013-07-04T12:24:14.768Z"], "_version_": 1761117122301263872, "ispartof": ["o:168770", "o:294903", "o:424738"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "Preservation of Federal Digital Publications: GPO, Federal Depository Libraries, and Other Federal Agencies: Presentation - iPRES 2006 - Ithaca", "sort_dc_title": "Preservation of Federal Digital Publications: GPO, Federal Depository Libraries, and Other Federal Agencies: Presentation - iPRES 2006 - Ithaca", "tsize": [135115.0], "tmodified": ["2017-03-02T02:26:43.849Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:294903", "__source_name": "iPRES", "__year": 2006}
