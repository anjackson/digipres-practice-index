It is energy, in the form of electricity, which allows us to write physical marks on various substrates and energy which allows us to read those marks. The industrial revolution, powered by coal and oil, supercharged our technology by greatly increasing the amount of energy available to us at only the cost of extraction. This surge of cheap energy into our civilization was what allowed us to advance our technology and develop computers and the digital realm. As we move into the middle of this century, energy will affect our ability to preserve digital materials in two critical ways. First, the age of cheap oil is coming to an end. As oil becomes more expensive to extract, less and less energy will be available. Second, the byproducts of burning fossil fuels such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrogen, create greenhouse gasses (GHGs) which have warmed our atmosphere and destabilized our climate. The more energy we use from fossil fuels, the more we create an inhospitable planet. In order to proactively plan for the future ahead of us, the digital preservation community needs to become aware of the risks inherent in our critical dependency on energy and enact adaptation strategies to address those threats. Methodologies, like those presented in the Decision Making Under Deep Uncertainty (DMDU) suite, provide a way of selecting strategies that are adaptive to multiple futures. While there’s no way of knowing what the future will bring, the current state of our climate guarantees that it will not be business as usual.","Energy underpins life and all digital preservation efforts, primarily through electricity. The industrial revolution, fueled by coal and oil, significantly advanced our technology due to the abundant energy it provided. However, as the era of inexpensive oil wanes, energy shortages and greenhouse gas emissions threaten our climate and digital preservation capabilities. The digital preservation community must recognize these risks and adopt adaptive strategies to navigate the uncertain future ahead, utilizing methodologies like Decision Making Under Deep Uncertainty (DMDU).",Sibyl Schaefer,Sibyl Schaefer,,https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/1sm257xx/,,https://doi.org/10.21428/5676bf2d.0e7a6a0e,2024-09-19,14:00,25 minutes,https://zenodo.org/records/13787636,concerthall,The Constraints When Scaling Up Preservation Efforts,https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/fac102093df84a8c93031824fad34cd95d7f83fd04574b0884545e07bee9e47f,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lDWYct0heJztUyK5nOaDaLFRBO-Yx4PXT5URfiK3xZo/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po,Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)

The proposed three-stage cyclical workflow involves: 1. The collection of evidence of the artwork’s intended performance from existing variants, literature, artist interviews, and data analysis, 2. Building reference variants in EaaS based on the evidence, and 3. The comparison of existing and reference variants’ performances and the documentation of observations in a relational database.

The condition reporting methodology developed from this research revealed a practical documentation framework for managing information regarding complex multi-variant networked digital artworks, using a relational database. This dynamic, open-ended, and cyclical workflow is consistent with the in-process nature of net art and its intrinsic focus on access and performance indicates its potential for an all-encompassing preservation approach.

Most cloud storage vendors offer guarantees of file durability that call into question the need for continuous fixity checking as often performed by repositories with file servers located on-premises. At the same time, cloud vendors tend to charge fees for bringing computational resources to bear on individual files, turning continuous fixity checking into a potentially burdensome expense. With these technical and business considerations in mind, this paper explores one institution’s solution to verifying fixity in a repository of approximately seventeen million files after transition from on-site to cloud storage. It evaluates broader considerations for the field of digital preservation when considering file integrity in the cloud and concludes with an explanation of a local policy for ongoing fixity monitoring adapted to the affordances of a cloud-adapted architecture.","The transition from on-premises storage to cloud solutions has prompted digital preservation managers to rethink file integrity assurance.

This work is being undertaken within academic and cultural institutions and also by the public. Some of this heritage exists on cassette tapes upon which data is encoded as sound. Current preservation practices implicitly privilege the preservation of the bytes encoded on the tape but not necessarily the original audio signal itself. This case study of Australian educational programs recovered from 40 year old cassettes suggests that their original signals contain evidence of an atypical mastering process and in doing so exemplify Kirschenbaum’s (2008) delineation between the forensic and formal materiality of digital objects. By extending this delineation, for the first time, to software on cassette this article attests to the ongoing theoretical value of Kirschenbaum’s thesis. It further suggests that cassette software preservation practices be aligned with those of physical object conservation in which an ethical responsibility to preserve ‘evidence of manufacture’ has long been acknowledged.","The importance of preserving microcomputer software as part of our digital heritage is increasingly acknowledged, with efforts from academic, cultural institutions, and the public.

Arriving at our desired destination, the launch of QSA Digital Archive, it's as if we've barely beat the clock.
Like Marty McFly's quest to alter the future, we have challenged conventional thinking, remodelled the way we engage with our agencies, reshaped transfer processes and workflows to adapt to the ever-evolving landscape of digital preservation and the needs of our users. Along the way, we have recalibrated our assumptions and questioned the very feasibility of transfers themselves, grappling with the reality of preserving our digital heritage in a rapidly changing world. 
As we reflect on our odyssey, we ponder: is this the future we envisioned when we embarked on our quest to safeguard our digital legacy, or do we fear that the legacy will become lost to the memories of future generations despite our ambitions? 
As we navigate the digital archive time machine to explore the agency landscape, are we encountering confidence and readiness to confront the challenges ahead? The digital preservation maturity of our agencies varies significantly, ranging from struggles in identifying permanent digital records to grappling with creators of large, complex datasets that exceed the capabilities of this iteration of the digital archive.

CHARM establishes a conceptual definition of digital preservation risk built around a purposeful definition of digital preservation as a goal and value-based endeavour, then deconstructs this to develop a cascading and logical series of abstract models for the whole digital preservation domain. This paper introduces the methodology though which CHARM was developed, presents and explains some of the key CHARM models, and discusses some of the methods through which CHARM can support scoped yet holistic risk identification and risk assessment exercises.

But looking at the history of DDS, some of these initial values hardly came to fruition because others like innovation were prioritized. The ideological commitments of the founders arguably predetermined which values would win out in practice.

The metadata are collected from these repositories, enriched with metadata from other sources, and then transformed to accord with the Swedish National Archives recent implementation (aka FGS 2.0) of the European Common Specification for Information Packages (E-ARK CSIP) and Specification for Submission Information Packages (E-ARK SIP) versions 2.1.0. The metadata records are then stored in the SU local (temporal) archive together with the associated data files harvested simultaneously. Part of the motivation for this preparatory digital preservation work are the perceived risks of trusting the digital preservation of research data files produced by SU reseachers to external repositories, that we do not fully control locally. The end product of this harvest and transformation processing are SIPs (Submission Information Packages), still awaiting future transformation to AIPs (Archival Information Packages) and eventually DIPs (Dissemination Information Packages). The associated data files are not transformed or converted in this first step towards long-term preservation and archiving, but we keep track of the file formats ingested partly by mapping file extensions to mimetypes in a special registry xml-file, used in the transformation processing and continuously updated whenever ""new"" file formats are encountered for the first time.

The software scripts that were developed for this ""harvester combine"" are in BASH Unix Shell, XQuery and XSLT. The processing of metadata, data and scripts occurs locally using Git Bash (for Windows), BaseX and Oxygen XML editor, but is essentially software-tool agnostic. Metadata input sources are e.g. OAI-PMH feeds (Datacite or METS), repository specific APIs (to get necessary file metadata) or generic command line scripts (for checksums and file sizes in some cases). Only recently we have also created a cross-sectional Digital Preservation Group at Stockholm University Library, whose first task is to create an inventory of all (external or internal) source informations systems (e.g. data repositories), together with their local destination archival or storage systems. This inventory is then aimed to serve as a basis for a digital preservation plan for future long-term preservation.","Stockholm University is developing a ""Harvest Combine"" tool to transform metadata and data files from various repositories used by its researchers, despite lacking a compliant digital archive.

indico036,Working on a Budget with WANG disks and other obscure formats,2024-03-04 14:00:21.861692+00:00,Workshop,Monday Workshops,Information Technology for DP,Scaling up,"Memory institutions are grappling with the challenges posed by digital carriers in their collections. While solutions for more recent carriers like hard drives, optical discs, and flash storage are readily available, the landscape becomes trickier when dealing with older formats such as floppy disks. It is becoming increasingly difficult to source the hardware, such as 5.25” floppy drives. There are many boards that can read flux streams, including the KryoFlux, and the Award-winning Archivist’s Guide to KryoFlux (https://github.com/archivistsguidetokryoflux/archivists-guide-to-kryoflux) can help to get started. But KryoFlux is somewhat limited in the disk formats it can interpret and might be too expensive for smaller institutions. We came together as practitioners because we encountered disk formats that required additional efforts to read and extract files from. We explored hardware such as Greaseweazle and using FluxEngine software to read less common disk formats. Sharing the knowledge we have gained, this tutorial and workshop present an opportunity for participants to delve into these formats, examining them from both hardware and formatting perspectives.

The session will start with a tutorial designed to showcase various options and tools (FluxEngine, GreaseWeazle), demonstrating how to make aging equipment compatible with contemporary machines. At the end of the tutorial, participants should have the knowledge to build their own forensic workstation for 5.25” and 3.5” floppy disks. 

Commencing with case studies, the workshop in the second half of the session will unravel the complexities of dealing with obscure formats and share valuable lessons learned. Participants will be equipped with practical tips and tricks for identification and handling, including utilizing Hex Editors and using tools for specific obscure disk formats (such as WANG). The aim is to empower participants with the skills and knowledge needed to navigate the challenges associated with older formats.

Encouraging an interactive environment, the workshop invites participants to share their experiences in tackling obscure formats. Whether seasoned professionals or newcomers to the field, everyone is welcome to contribute, fostering a collaborative exchange of insights. The inclusive nature of the workshop ensures that participants, regardless of their level of expertise, will find value in the discussions and practical demonstrations.",,"Leontien Talboom, Elizabeth Kata, Chris Knowles, Tyler Thorsted","Leontien Talboom, Elizabeth Kata, Chris Knowles, Tyler Thorsted",,,,,2024-09-16,11:00,2 hours,https://zenodo.org/records/13828372,loveling,,,,Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)

The project has been drawn up since 2011 and organized using an innovative approach in France, for archives and recordkeeping sectors, but also for public services in general, involving records managers, archivists and IT professionals. In addition to its funding ministries (Culture, Foreign Affairs, Defense), it now has more than seventy partners from the public and the private sectors.

The software development is using Agile method. It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement, and fosters rapid and flexible response to change. But on top of that, the project focuses on user satisfaction. This implies an active collaboration between archivists and IT professionals (developers) to achieve the development of the software. The building of a shared culture/knowledge, or for the less of a mutual understanding and comprehensibility are the keys of the project success. In spring 2024, the Vitam 7.1 will be released. 

During this workshop, the Vitam team will present the organization of the program, and give an overview of the concepts, functionalities and roadmap of the Vitam software. There will also be a hands-on exercises, allowing attendees to familiarize themselves with the Vitam software, from records acquisition to access, archives lifecycle management and preservation.

Moreover, social media play a very important role in communicating about various social topics and do so by a wide range of actors. As such, the channels serve as a valuable source for (scientific) research, but, because of the volatile nature of the content, they are still rarely archived. We collaborated with KADOC-KU Leuven in the project Best Practices for the Archiving of Social Media in Flanders and Brussels, to research how to capture and archive this specific online information and make it future-proof. During the project, we tested a large number of tools, developed workflows and wrote manuals for archiving social media, and published them on our knowledge base. The manuals are written to facilitate users with little to no IT skills to start archiving social media. 

An overview of the published manuals and workflows on our knowledge base:
- [Archiving YouTube videos using Tartube](https://www.projectcest.be/wiki/Publicatie:YouTube_video%27s_archiveren_met_Tartube) 
- [Archiving social media accounts using ArchiveWeb.page](https://www.projectcest.be/wiki/Publicatie:Sociale_media_accounts_archiveren_met_ArchiveWeb.page)

Andra, the French national radioactive waste management agency, documents its nuclear waste repositories mostly in this format, with a requirement to preserve some of this documentation over multi-century timescales at least.  The impermanence of computing and complexity of the PDF format make the latter inappropriate for such timescales, and Andra has consequently taken the route of printing these documents on permanent paper.  In the process however, in addition to the resulting high page count, digital integrity is lost which jeopardizes automated processing of text (e.g. search, translation, sorting) as it becomes dependent on the hypothetical future availability of perfect OCR.  To try and benefit from the best of both digital and analog, the Micr’Olonys solution from Eupalia, already tested at Andra on a database, was extended with a preparer utility, called Sumetar, to convert PDF files into plain UTF-8 encoded text files associated with images in the BMP format or printed in analog form.  Plain text and the BMP format are both very simple yet widespread, and are therefore suited for long term as well as current accessibility.  Sumetar packages multiple files into a single uncompressed tar file, another very simple format.  Micr’Olonys then transcribes the digital file into 2D barcodes printed on paper for passive preservation.  Tests carried out in late 2023 show that this strategy typically offers a four-fold reduction in page count for a document with roughly one image every two pages on average.","Many organizations store information as PDFs, but Andra, the French nuclear waste management agency, needs to preserve its documentation for centuries.

The initial dance of negotiation between library and donor collaborations sets the tone for the ongoing relationship between the two. Across the departments in VTUL that manage such relationships with donors and curate digital collections, there are common trends emerging in barriers and observations with building relationships, and also with the concessions, compromises, and adjustments made to meet the curation needs of both parties. There are noted gaps in priorities and knowledge of curation processes, expectations around the understanding of digital collections, communication and roles and responsibilities, and resource understandability and availability. This paper specifically addresses relationships with donors and that impact on the subsequent work resulting from agreement with both parties.

Continuing the iPRES conversation around community archiving and successful collaborations, the authors of this paper look critically at their partnerships with donors of digital material. This paper aligns with the conference theme “Start 2 preserve” in that it both addresses the barriers to entering the digital preservation landscape for the non-librarian community, and the barriers of digital preservation practitioners in aligning collaborator needs with digital curation needs. The authors focus on spotlighting the learning curve present on both sides of the work of community archiving. In recognizing recurrent gaps in understanding, this paper aims to be a part of a larger conversation on how community partnerships can blossom with built trust and understanding, coupled with robust planning and technical capability.","Virginia Tech University Libraries (VTUL) collaborates with diverse communities to enhance online accessibility, though their specific needs often differ.

It’s a lightweight, yet powerful instrument that is available on every computer. It allows you to manage your computer or automate repetitive tasks, but can also be used to carry out digital preservation tasks and quality control, with tools like e.g. Jhove, FFmpeg, bagIT, rclone, ExifTool, Xmlstarlet or Siegfried. Useful for every (digital) archivist whose nature of work has shifted from paper to digital. 

Why use the command line?
-------------------------

The command line is one of the most useful and efficient tools we have as computer users, but it can feel overwhelming when you first start using the tool. Small cultural heritage organisations do not always have the means to hire a full-time IT professional, requiring employees to familiarise themselves with new digital skills and tools. In our hands-on workshop, we will guide the participants in taking their first steps using the command line to carry out various digital preservation tasks.

What will you learn?
--------------------
We will dive deeper into tools for working with files in bulk:
 - validating files with Jhove or a Tiff validator;
 - transcoding videos with FFmpeg;
 - transferring files from an online storage service to an offline storage using rclone;
- reading and writing embedded metadata in image, audio and video with ExifTool;
- extracting information from XML files with Xmlstarlet;
- identifying files with Siegfried;
- packaging files in a bagIT;
- ...

The exact list may change depending on the needs or questions of the participants. We expect to introduce 4 to 5 command line tools.

The Windows command prompt and Powershell are not compatible with the command line interface of macOS and Ubuntu. That is why Windows users need to install Microsoft’s WSL2 and set up Ubuntu before joining the workshop.

How has higher education transformed technology? The learning experience for University students today bears very little resemblance to the experience of a student who matriculated in, say, 1970. The methods for delivering teaching, submitting assessments, and interacting with peers have completely transformed institutions of higher learning as well as the type of skills and capabilities of their graduates. These changes have contributed to a widespread transformation of the UK’s economy – indeed the global economy – which touch almost every aspect of life.
This paper describes a student internship at the University of Edinburgh aimed at preserving legacy issues of the University’s Computing Services’ newsletter BITs (Bulletin of IT Services). The newsletter provides unique detail about how the implementation of new technologies – like the ‘Good old Internet’ – have supported and even driven seismic change to University education. These digital archives provide rich insights into how new technologies were perceived by staff, priorities for resourcing new platforms, and the day-to-day changes to working and studying brought on by new tools and services. However, until summer 2023, many of those archives were trapped on decaying CDs and DVDs stored by the Graphic Design team.
Through a close collaboration between Graphic Design and Digital Archives, a student internship was developed to help recover these historic glimpses of technological innovation at the University in the late 90s and early 00s. Without resourcing for a dedicated space for forensics processing, the team assembled an ‘on-the-fly’ forensics station. Though far from ideal, the on-the-fly workstation allowed the student intern to sit with the Graphic Design team to ask questions about past projects and ways of working. Facing numerous challenges (such as training a first-year undergraduate on digital preservation, forensics software, and how to open a jewel case), this project helped to demonstrate that without dedicated funding, many important resources from across the University will be lost. However, the project also enjoyed a few highly rewarding victories, including recovery of (almost) all the legacy editions of BITs and watching a Gen Z undergraduate explain Y2K to peer student interns.","How has technology impacted higher education, and vice versa?

However, there are problems, such as delayed submission and incomplete data from publishers, that negatively impact the long-term preservation of digital science and technology resources. Therefore, it is necessary to perform a performance quality evaluation to serve as an effective means of restraint. [Method/Process] The key indicators in the long-term preservation agreement were extracted based on the implementation work. The evaluation indicators were enhanced through expert investigation to establish a performance quality evaluation system for publishers. Subsequently, the NDPC institution conducted scoring and division of levels to identify common issues and propose incentive and constraint mechanisms. [Results/Conclusion] The long-term preservation of digital science and technology resources lack robust business-oriented constraints. It is recommended to establish incentive and constraint mechanisms from combining long-term preservation to contract renewal, publicity of ranking, and data crawling authorization to urge publishers to enhance performance quality.","Since 2013, the National Digital Preservation Center (NDPC) has established 71 agreements for the preservation of digital science and technology resources, but issues like delayed submissions and incomplete data from publishers hinder these efforts.

It is designed to promote long-term object management best practices within digital repositories. OCFL v1 was released in 2020 with a minor update to v1.1 in 2022 containing clarifications and corrections. OCFL is currently supported by the Fedora Commons Repository Platform, the InvenioRDM Platform that underlies Zenodo, LibNova products and a number of other digital preservation-oriented systems.   

This session will be divided into three sections:

Design Philosophy - The session will begin with a presentation on the history of OCFL and how the design process analysed community-provided use cases and requirements to derive a set of key objectives for OCFL. The objectives will then be examined in more detail.

Implementing OCFL v1 - The presentation will be followed by a more discursive session where we will go through the OCFL v1.1 specification and accompanying Implementation Notes, and discuss how it is implemented in practice. In particular, we will look at how OCFL aims to be self-documenting and the use of the extension mechanism to expand OCFL functionality and documentability without compromising the core specification. We will also look at the available tests, fixtures and code libraries that are available to support implementers, with the opportunity for hands-on exploration.

Towards v2 - The process towards a v2 release of the specification is already underway. The session will finish with a discussion of the use cases being considered for inclusion in v2 as a result of community engagements over the past 18 months and progress by the OCFL Editorial team to date, with a view to encouraging more participation and contributions.",,Neil Jefferies,Neil Jefferies,"Andrew Woods, Julian Morley, Rosalyn Metz, Simeon Warner",,,,2024-09-16,12:00,2 hours,,anatomicaltheater,,,,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)

Communities, groups and individuals are the prime custodians of ICH. The existing approaches and methodologies for linking data in tangible heritage cannot be practised in the context of (meta)dating ICH.

During the project pURIs for immaterieelerfgoed.be: Building Blocks for Digital Transformation in the Cultural Heritage Sector, NGO Workshop Intangible Heritage Flandres researched how to develop a persistent and sustainable data practise for ICH. The project addressed **questions relating to the tension between the principles behind open data on the one hand, and the stewardship of communities over their living and evolving ICH on the other**. Immaterieelerfgoed.be is the platform for ICH in Flanders and Brussels. It includes inventories of ICH. The content of these inventories mainly take on the form of descriptive data and are collated through co-creation.

**To achieve an ethical data practice, the rights and well-being of the ICH community involved in all phases of the data life cycle on - and beyond - immaterieelerfgoed.be have to be prioritised**. The aim is to reduce the potential harm that data sharing may cause to the communities involved, e.g. the misuse of heritage that has customary restrictions on access and use). By building upon known principles for data sharing, combining FAIR (open and persistent data sharing) and CARE (people and purposes oriented data sharing), a methodology to map the current data practice applied on immaterieelerfgoed.be has been developed. Additionally a series of actions to establish an ethical data strategy, ensuring both clean and open data and agency and advocacy of the ICH communities, has been discerned. 

During the course of the project, we scrutinised the current registration module for the ICH inventories, applied user agreements and privacy policies and the attribution of rights statements and reuse licences (e.g. Creative Commons). We researched how we can implement persistent URI’s and install an opt-out option for them without breaking their persistence. In addition we found that it is indispensable that the communities concerned have to be sensitised about the impact of sharing their data.","Intangible cultural heritage (ICH) is dynamic, evolving with societal changes, and is primarily safeguarded by communities and individuals. The project pURIs for immaterieelerfgoed.be aimed to create a sustainable data practice for ICH, exploring the balance between open data principles and community stewardship. Immaterieelerfgoed.be serves as a platform for ICH in Flanders and Brussels, focusing on descriptive data gathered through collaboration.

indico056,Digital preservation in the cloud?,2024-03-12 15:54:55.403912+00:00,Panel,Interactive formats,Information Technology for DP,Scaling up,"In recent years more and more commercial solutions for support of digital preservation are moving to the cloud, e.g. Preservica and Rosetta. Others, such as Arkivum, have been implemented as hosted applications with attached cloud-storage from the start. The number of cloud-customers are growing, which means that customers on enterprise solutions must consider cloud solutions to get extra benefits or because the support for on-premise solutions will be terminated at some stage. To some organisations, this poses a major problem, since they might have institutional regulations, policies or other reasons why a cloud solution is not a possibility.
Preservation involves both long-term access and access rights protection, and requirements will vary for different types of materials, for instance, open data versus sensitive data such as social science research data, that needs extra protection due to its nature and legal issues.
With cloud-based storage architectures and cloud-based services the spectrum of how things are kept safe has become more diverse than ever. Moreover, there are differences in whether the bit preservation of metadata and files is in the cloud or on-premise. 
 
This panel will consist of representatives from organisations or projects researching and evaluating preservation solutions or using commercial solutions either on-premise or in the cloud.
The panel will discuss the following issues and try to learn from each other’s insights.
 

·         What is the take of various heritage organisations on this development towards the cloud?
 -     Which barriers do you see in having application and/or storage in the cloud
·         Which risks do you see when using or not using the cloud, e.g. cyber security or shut down of the solution?
·         Which challenges or opportunities do they see in e.g. finances, maintenance, scalability? 
·         How do they envision exit strategies for cloud solutions?
 
The discussion will focus on the cloud questions independent of commercial solutions used by the organisations.

Understanding a file from a technical standpoint is important but equally as so is understanding the institution’s ability to preserve it for the long term. In other words, all risk is local. But how to assess that risk in a meaningful and consistent way across widely diverse collections? There is no one size fits all approach. Instead, institutions of all sizes can assess format risk in a manner that is appropriate for their organization. Two U.S. federal government agencies, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and the Library of Congress discuss their approaches to risk assessment through digital file format assessment including the similarities and differences in their approaches, which were designed to meet the different goals of their institutions. The Library of Congress utilizes a number of mechanisms including the Recommended Formats Statement, which has a defined and publicly available evaluation criteria matrix, as well as research from the Sustainability of Digital Formats. NARA issues Transfer Guidance that identifies preferred and acceptable file formats for the transfer of permanent records for preservation, as well as guidance for federal records managers about specific categories of records, such as email or social media. NARA's guidance is based on a risk assessment process for individual versions of formats, which is shared publicly through the NARA Digital Preservation Framework. Both NARA and Library of Congress’ approaches were born from a shared framework which diverged over time to meet each institution’s goals and needs.","Evaluating file formats is crucial for assessing digital content risks, requiring both technical understanding and long-term preservation capabilities from institutions. Different organizations must find tailored approaches to format risk assessment, as exemplified by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and the Library of Congress, each of which has developed unique strategies based on their institutional goals. While the Library of Congress uses a public evaluation criteria matrix and research on digital format sustainability, NARA provides guidelines for preferred formats and specific records management, both stemming from a common framework that evolved to meet their distinct needs.","Elizabeth England, Hannah Wang, Kate Murray, Theron Westervelt","Elizabeth England, Hannah Wang, Kate Murray, Leslie Johnston, Theron Westervelt",,https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/xtwb1guc/,,https://doi.org/10.21428/5676bf2d.49f901e4,2024-09-17,12:00,25 minutes,https://zenodo.org/records/13750624,concerthall,Models & Strategies for Collaboration,https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/bd35e0d952454965a64a917ee3741564b70655a27ed640c5aad0d31be3cee8ec,https://docs.google.com/document/d/18q7nGVrhTj5qLOs3b-qg74krPB0yPTA0GoltsBuA2w0/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po,Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)

In an attempt to scale up a work-intensive process, the authors have turned to a crowd-sourced approach, with the first step consisting of better identifying Inria's software heritage. 
More specifically, the article discusses the outcomes of a survey sent to current and past Inria employees. Its aim was to identify landmark legacy software products of the institute, available source codes, and possible contributors to a future collective archiving effort. 
Unsurprisingly, the survey found that older software pieces are less likely to be identified, with only a small subset of early-age Inria software production being reported in the survey. The availability of associated source codes also varies, with older software being more likely to have partially or completely lost source code, or to be stored on obsolescent media. Source code from recent software however is more likely to be available on modern collaborative platforms like Github or Gitlab, ensuring safe archiving via the Software Heritage universal archive.
In conclusion, the Inria survey confirms the urgent need to identify and preserve historical software items, especially those from the earlier decades which are at higher risk to be definitively lost if no preservation effort is made. We believe that, due to the broad scale and breadth of this effort, the lessons learned will be of interest to other institutions and software preservation initiatives.
As a next step, we plan to set up a dedicated framework to empower Inria alumni to contribute to the preservation of the legacy codes, and we call on other institutions to join in this effort, paving the way for many other crowd-sourcing source code preservation initiatives.","The article highlights the collaborative efforts by Software Heritage and the Inria Alumni Network to identify and preserve Inria's historical software artifacts.

This is a large (115 meters x 14 meters, 1610m2) painting (oil on canvas) made by two Belgian painters for the International Exhibition in Ghent (1913). It was created to propagate the Belgian involvement in Congo. Today, it is part of the collection of the War Heritage Institute in Belgium. In its lifetime it was only exhibited twice. Since its last exhibition at the Brussels’ World Fair of 1935, the painting has been in storage. Due to its scale, its material condition and the need for a large custom-built building to display it, chances the canvas itself will be exhibited in the foreseeable future are extrtemely small. This situation called for a ‘digital rescue operation’. With very few best practices for working on this scale available, the team devised a working method to unroll and photograph the canvas. Among other things, the working method included 15+ volunteers and two tanks from the Belgian Army. After months of preparation, the painting was photographed in a military warehouse by a team of photographers from the research team in December 2022. This was followed by an intensive period of stitching the 800+ images together. Next to the technical challenges of this process, we want to highlight some ethical implications of digitizing  colonial heritage.

This kind of strategy allows for managing growth and change without losing too much of one’s mind.","Since May 2010, the National Library of France (BnF) has implemented a versatile preservation system that has evolved alongside the influx of diverse materials and hardware updates.

Through staff interviews, an overview of current practices for describing collections, providing access, and engaging users are analyzed for the first time, revealing significant disparities between institutions and a lack of best practices to address unique challenges in curating and managing access to web archives.

The role of best practice is assessed, finding whilst some alignment with existing standards exists, there is an urgent need for developing best practices based on existing consensus and wider digital preservation frameworks. This approach acknowledges the significant challenges facing web archive practitioners as well as users.

The paper then looks ahead to next steps – highlighting three areas of inequity to urgently address alongside three areas where equitable practices are emerging and require continued community support. This ‘way forward’ begins to redress the power imbalances inherent in information creation and distribution, enabling web archives to fulfil their responsibilities to the public as custodians of their online heritage.","This study analyzes the equitable access to UK Public Sector Web Archives, highlighting the disparities among institutions in collection management and user engagement.

These skills are becoming increasingly important to digital preservation, with “Computer Programming” listed as one of the skill elements in the Digital Preservation Coalition’s (DPC) Competency Framework. For those new to these skills, it can be intimidating and difficult to know where to start. The popularity of the Bits and Bots and BitCurator/DPC Python study groups are evidence of this. The contributors to this tutorial are drawn from the leadership of both programs, and have witnessed first-hand the strong desire for coding skills amongst practitioners. This tutorial aims to be a first step in their coding journey for practitioners who attend.
 
Participants will collaborate in groups to create a game centered around the theme of digital preservation. In the process, they will learn basic coding skills and will finish with their own interactive text based game on a shareable website. Prompts, ideas, templates and sub themes will be provided to help participants create their game. This will also have the secondary benefits of allowing participants to consider digital preservation from a different perspective, and to gain a better understanding of how websites are built and work, knowledge that will help them make more informed preservation decisions about web content.
The collaborative nature of the tutorial on the conference's first day presents an opportunity for participants to kick off iPRES 2024 in a fun and social way, connecting with colleagues worldwide. Sharing experiences in digital preservation often proves to be the most valuable learning experience, and this tutorial is designed to foster such knowledge exchange among participants.
 
**Tutorial outcomes**
By the end of the tutorial, participants will have: 
-Fundamental coding skills 
-Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS 
-Awareness of how tools can be used to develop interactive web content 
-A game they can share and/or continue to develop (further building their skills) 
-Gained a new perspective/level of understanding of digital preservation
-Made new connections with fellow practitioners",,"Ellie O’Leary, Francesca Mackenzie, Lotte Wijsman, Sharon McMeekin, Susanne van den Eijkel","Ellie O’Leary, Francesca Mackenzie, Lotte Wijsman, Sharon McMeekin, Susanne van den Eijkel",,,,,2024-09-16,11:00,3 hours,,artiestenfoyer,,,,Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)

Through collaboration and resource sharing, AIDA develops strategies and solutions for this purpose.

Since the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, vast amounts of data have been stored on digital media like floppy disks, zip disks, and jaz disks. Modern workstations often cannot read them. This threatens data loss for every heritage organisation, from national archives to local historical societies.

Migrating data from outdated to modern storage media is complex, and not all organisations can set up a capture station for different digital media types on their own. They must first locate suitable legacy reading equipment and then connect it to modern workstations. Additionally, they need software to transfer the complete contents of the media to contemporary storage without alterations.

AIDA Capture-Lab
----------------

The AIDA Capture-Lab is operated from the meemoo offices in Ghent and provides an obsolete data carrier capture service available for cultural heritage organisations. The capture lab was founded by AIDA in 2019 as a result of the [Digital Repair Cafe project](https://meemoo.be/en/projects/digital-repair-cafe). By bringing together and sharing resources and knowledge, data transfer is much more efficient and sustainable. All workflows and setups are documented on the [AIDA Capture Lab website](https://automatic-ingest-digital-archives.github.io/Digital-Repair-Cafe/).

RODA-In
-------

We demonstrate the process of using RODA-In to convert digital archival data into Submission Information Packages (SIPs) for ingestion into e-depots.

RODA-In is a free and open-source tool which creates SIPs from local files and folders and offers features such as:
- creating, loading, and editing classification schemas;
- automatic association of files/folders and metadata with SIP;
- definition of metadata templates;
- support for various metadata formats (EAD, DC, etc.);
- creating SIPs in various formats.

-------------

In this tutorial, we will illustrate how to retrieve data from outdated digital media and package it into SIPs. We encourage active participation by having the audience bring their legacy media to retrieve and package data into a SIP alongside us.",,"Jelle Kleevens, Lode Scheers, Nastasia Vanderperren","Jelle Kleevens, Lode Scheers, Nastasia Vanderperren",,,,,2024-09-19,13:30,1h 30m,,artiestenfoyer,,,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZRHGDulUvWl1UDgZ4y9oJI64sRbqr_6dNtDJnQVDZ58/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po,Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)

This work aims to replace the Digital Repository Service (DRS) that Harvard Library has maintained for 25 years as a highly customized homegrown preservation system. Although subject to continual enhancement over time, the DRS has now reached the effective limits of its conceptual design and operational capacity and needs to go through a generational modernization. The Library set a high benchmark for project success in terms of ten aspirational goals for support of “any” content, conditions, users, and uses.  In a departure from traditional enterprise procurement practice, the project also adopted a framework of ten “radical” transformative work principles.

One of its entities is the Preservation and Migration Commission (PMC), which deals with aspects related to the preservation and migration of any audiovisual content from a long-time perspective when it comes to: Analogue and Digital Preservation Processes, Migration to Digital, Long-term Digital Preservation, Digital Restoration and Quality improvement, File Formats and Standards.
A delegation of PMC members will propose a half-a-day workshop during which we can compare our strategies and cases with other members of the iPres global digital preservation community.
Audio-visual content may be seen as any other type of document, however it has specific properties and preservation issues. First, for analogue and non-file-based formats, migration is definitely a need, a “one best chance” to do it properly while catching all possible errors, in order to produce preservation-quality content.
In the digital domain, audio-visual content requires a lot of storage, and preservation has to deal with the increasing number of file formats and with demanding access modalities when integrating archives with production and communication to the public.
Also, audio-visual content is often complemented and referenced by other types of documents (i.e. ancillary elements and data).
Once the basics and the most common strategies for migration and digital preservation are explained, a number of practical cases are going to be presented, which will offer an opportunity to interact with the audience. What would have been your choice of strategy, if it was your case? 
The discussion will cover the nature of the audio-visual SIP; how to validate it; how to meet quality expectations; how many copies are needed to ensure preservation; how to maintain data integrity; how to document provenance; etc…",,"Charles Fairall, Etienne Marchand, Laurent Boch, Marijn Daniels, Miroslav Culjat, Sunny Tan","Charles Fairall, Etienne Marchand, Laurent Boch, Marijn Daniels, Miroslav Culjat, Peter Schallauer, Sunny Tan",,,,,2024-09-16,12:00,3 hours,,kraakhuis,,,,Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)

Through literature and case-study research into cultural archival practices in Flanders (Belgium), this article explores the ontological conditions preceding the practice of institutional cultural archiving. Recommendations are formulated to develop a community-oriented institutional archival practice that is responsive to how cultural memory operates, to what constitutes the community record, and to the need to not only talk with communities but also to engage in connection between communities.

Three insights are presented. Firstly, the strategy of community-based archiving needs to incorporate the model of cultural archiving, emphasizing the ‘archiving’ of the community record. Secondly, a relevant and proactive institutional attitude is required that focusses through outreach on the boundary-spanning capacities of the community record, rather than on strengthening the boundary markers. Finally, an institutional cultural archival praxis is perceived as a laboratory for discussing perspectives on the making of memory and meaning, with a focus on intercommunity and intercultural recognition. Since these preconditions for implementing such a praxis are not yet met in the field, this article refrains from concrete techno-practical discussions but encourages further research and practical experiments.

The author of this article is employed at a local public archival institution in a small to medium-sized city in the Flemish region of Belgium. Additionally, the author is affiliated with the University of Antwerp, where he works on a dissertation on the role of archives in society.

Email collections of historic value present specific acquisition challenges to collecting institutions, raising a host of technical, legal, and ethical questions. While the tools and workflows for collecting email have steadily matured in recent years, there is still little guidance on how to acquire email collections in the first place. 

An independent group of archivists and records managers representing leading university libraries, international centers for email research, corporate archives, and cultural heritage organizations (with members located across the US, Canada, and the UK) formed in 2021 to discuss these issues and have been compiling good practice recommendations into a guide for the benefit of other practitioners. This guide will be released as a draft in 2024 for community feedback.

This workshop will offer participants the opportunity to connect with peers and critically evaluate the draft release of the email acquisition good practice guide. Attendees should review the draft prior to attending the workshop and arrive prepared to discuss how the report corresponds with their experience of working with email collections and its prospective usefulness for future accessioning of email. 

The workshop will begin with a brief overview of the guide, its background, and a high-level summary of its recommendations. Attendees will then circulate to stations based on specific sections of the guide and brainstorm what works well and what could be improved. Remote attendees will hold discussions in a parallel set of Zoom breakout rooms correlating to each section of the guide.

It is designed to store, manage, and preserve digital content and is used by over 300 institutions around the world. Fedora has seen iterations over its 20+ year existence, but its core principles, focused on long-term digital preservation, have remained the same. Fedora is synonymous with stability and has long-remained a household name in the digital repository landscape.

The most recent major version of Fedora, Fedora 6.x, was released 3 years ago and there has been increasing migration efforts toward 6.x from users in outdated and unsupported older versions of the software. Fedora 6.x has sparked renewed interest in Fedora implementers because of the choice to incorporate the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) within the persistence layer. Fedora 6.x is being well received, and new and unique use cases are being discovered regularly as the community continues to expand.

The Fedora program is committed to supporting all migration efforts to 6.x. This workshop will provide a unique opportunity for attendees to “bring their own data” and conduct a live migration with the help and assistance of the Fedora technical team. Facilitators will work alongside participants to provide suggestions, offer best practices, gather use cases, and troubleshoot in real-time. While the workshop will be focused on the Fedora migration, if time permits (and depending on the complexity of the use cases), facilitators may be able to assist with configurations with common front-end solutions like Islandora and some Samvera applications. 

Workshop goals and objectives:
Introduce and familiarize participants with Fedora migration tools and processes.
Provide hands-on migration assistance with real-word data (or sample data if required).
Execute a migration to Fedora 6.x using available tooling and documentation.
Provide attendees with detailed information on available support channels, documentation and where and how to seek assistance beyond the workshop.

Proposed Workshop Structure:
1. Brief overview of the new features included in Fedora 6.x.
2. Introduction to Fedora 6.x migration tooling and documentation.
3. Open discussion about migration needs, use cases, barriers etc.
4. Facilitation of hands-on Fedora migrations.",,Dan Field,"Arran Griffith, Dan Field",,,,,2024-09-16,11:00,2 hours,,loveling,,,,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)

Those familiar, will know the number of error messages it reports. Currently, JHOVE supports different types of messages, ranging from error messages for validation failures which can indicate a problem with the file, to info messages covering everything else, e.g. too many PDF fonts for reporting. Even validation errors are varied, especially for complex file formats. In this workshop, the presenters will lend their considerable JHOVE experience to help users to analyse JHOVE error messages and diagnose problems in affected files.

The session targets beginners and practitioners. No experience in file format analysis is required of attendees. Before the workshop, we will circulate installation instructions and ask participants to bring examples of problematic files. This will allow participants to work with data and problems that feel familiar to them.

We will begin with a twenty-minute introductory session to JHOVE and its standard modules. We will then discuss the error message reports in more detail: how to interpret JHOVE messages and demonstrate the use of standard tools, like hex viewers/editors, file format standards and other file format analysis tools to find the location of errors in problematic files.  

The second part of the workshop will be hands-on, dividing the participants into small breakout groups. We will employ the techniques covered earlier to try to understand real-world error messages/file problems, using their own data or data provided by the facilitators. The presenters will moderate and assist up to three groups each, including online breakout rooms, during which we plan to engage both remote and onsite participants. 

There will then be a twenty-minute session to discuss the groups’ experiences. Attendees will be encouraged to report their successes and failures, as well as provide feedback as to how JHOVE reporting might be improved. We will conclude with a ten-minute session to debrief. While this can comfortably fit in an hour and a half, it could also be extended if needed. 

The minimum number of attendees would be twelve to fifteen people, but we can accommodate up to forty for this session.",,"Carl Wilson, Georgia Moppett, Micky Lindlar","Carl Wilson, Micky Lindlar",Georgia Moppett,,,,2024-09-16,11:00,2 hours,,loveling,,,,Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)

indico087,Series as the starting point. Unveiling the potential of series in digital preservation,2024-03-15 08:43:39.541394+00:00,Paper,Shorter on-site presentations of papers,Approaches to Preservation,Start 2 preserve,"To tackle the challenges faced by the expanding digitization of the government, the document management cluster of The Agency for Facility Operations of the Flemish Government, uses the concept of series: “a grouping of the same kind of administrative information created or received by the same governing body within the same process”. Because of its characteristics a series can play an important role in the world of digital preservation.
A series is used to describe information and to provide the relevant context. Additionally, it is used to establish certain management rules on inventory and contextualization, acquisition and disposal, access and consultation, preservation and destruction. The biggest advantage gained from this concept, is that rules on appraisal are not imposed upon file or record level, but upon series level. As a result, information is already given an retention period and appraised at a high level.
This paper starts with an insight into what a series is and how it functions in the Series Register. The paper then elaborates on four different ways in which series can be implemented: in a digital repository, in SharePoint, in a folder structure and finally to raise awareness on preservation in the workplace.","To address the challenges posed by the increasing digitization of government, the document management cluster of The Flemish Government's Agency for Facility Operations employs the concept of ""series,"" which refers to a collection of similar administrative information generated by the same governing body during the same process.

Decentralized and decoupled versions of value-adding services such as overlay journals, peer review, and endorsement services are provided to the network. These alternatives address not only the massive monopolization of scholarly communication but also new demands for rapid distribution of scholarly artifacts in fields such as life sciences. They also accommodate new publication formats, such as data sets and source code that are beyond the traditional paper. Event Notifications provide an asynchronous point-to-point messaging protocol that acts as an interoperability layer between the nodes in such networks. Event Logs are a proposal to provide full transparency in the scholarly process by publishing public resources on each node containing lifecycle information pertaining to the scholarly artifacts in the network. Trust in Event Logs requires some form of machine verifiability because trust by reputation of each node is not scalable in large networks. This paper presents a pragmatic approach to building trust without relying on costly blockchain technologies, which lack sustainable long-term strategies. By using trusted archival nodes within Event Notification networks and Event Logs, we propose a decentralized, transparent, and trustworthy alternative to traditional scholarly communication systems.","Alternative scholarly communication platforms are emerging, providing independent services that challenge traditional publishing models.

That call was given fresh impetus in 2023 by Sherry Williams and Ricky Punzalan who further articulated the barriers and benefits of community-engaged preservation. This panel progresses that discussion through the lens of ‘post-custodial’ approaches to digital preservation for ‘community-generated digital content’. ‘[Post-custodial][2]’ in this context refers to efforts that empower community centered data creators to preserve their own content when traditional memory institutions are not available or appropriate.  

The panel emerges from the ‘Our Heritage Our Stories’ project which has explored the challenges of sustaining a large number of small-scale, community-based digitization initiatives in the UK.  It draws on research, current practice, and case studies to propose a post-custodial toolkit for community generated digital content.  The toolkit is designed to improve the preservation outcomes of data classed as ‘[critically endangered][3]’ in the 2023 Global List of Endangered Digital Species. 

Post-custodial approaches are not devoid of problems.  For example, what is the appropriate relationship between community-driven approaches and existing memory institutions?  Do they undermine well established workflows; and how much is gained in return? How do we enable participatory metadata creation and management?  What technical steps are needed? How to resolve disputed meanings and contested access within preservation practice? How do post-custodial approaches relate to decolonization? Is there alignment with emerging expectations of indigenous data sovereignty in countries colonized by the West? What can be learned from the indigenous data sovereignty movement to enable community ownership of digital materials by marginalized or precarious groups in colonizing nations?

This lively panel will introduce and review post-custodial models of digital preservation and set them in a global perspective.  It will provoke comment from practitioners from different contexts, including from Aotearoa / New Zealand where data sovereignty principles have been impactful in the protection of land, culture and knowledge. Thus, the panel will maintain momentum through two previous iPres conferences while anticipating themes which are certain to arise in the next.

We will share how the CLOCKSS archive approached this, including how and when we engaged key stakeholders along the way, and explore ways that this could be generalised to be more broadly applicable throughout the international digital preservation community.

CLOCKSS began by setting out to find friends who could help us find a path. We were so lucky to find colleagues involved in the DIMPACT Project (https://dimpact.org/about). The DIMPACT community is focused on calculating and ultimately reducing the carbon footprint of digital communication and media companies and includes publishers such as Cambridge University Press, Elsevier, Institute of Physics Publishing, Oxford University Press, and Taylor & Francis.

We began by developing a component/functional map of our digital archive, and documenting:
1) The component parts of the system 
2) At a high level, how these components work 
3) How and where the service is used

Our aim was to unpack the ‘preservation’ black box that was part of the broader DIMPACT project diagram for all of digital publishing. 
 
The next step was to:
 
1.     Identify the significant energy-using components used to provide, maintain and deliver the preservation service and where each component was geographically located. For example, CLOCKSS securely preserves content in 11 different universities located in 7 countries.

2.    Identify how the preservation service is used, e.g. by how many users, the quantity or duration of service used per user, what devices the service is consumed on, what proportions of users use what kinds of devices, where the service is used (e.g. university, office, or home), etc. 

For each system component we then gathered relevant data (e.g. electricity source carbon intensities and usage and volumes of data transferred).

Finally, the carbon footprint will be estimated and we will be armed with the information to understand where and how we can make changes to reduce this. 

Now it is time to find friends, including those in the Digital Preservation Coalition, so that we can continue the journey together!",,"Alicia Wise, Danielle Taylor, Paul Shabajee, William Kilbride","Alicia Wise, Danielle Taylor, Guanwen ""Henry"" Zhang, Ianthe Sutherland, John McMillan, Paul Shabajee, Thib Guicherd-Callin, William Kilbride, William Pickett",,,,,2024-09-16,14:00,2 hours,,loveling,,,,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)

The ""Registries of Good Practice"" Project is a two-year collaboration between the Digital Preservation Coalition and Yale University Library, aiming to explore new ways to make the most of the sources of practical knowledge we have, without demanding large-scale change or expensive infrastructure. This workshop will present our prototypes for searching across format registries and for finding relevant publications, our approach to sustainable design and our vision for building a shared understanding of the landscape of registries and records relevant to digital preservation.

This will be followed by hands-on exploration of our new tools, to help attendees understand the range and coverage of the available registries, and learn new ways to find relevant records of technology and practice. This will help us to gather the user feedback that is critical to the success of the project and steer our future work. We will also use this workshop to document the wide range of records and registries that the digital preservation community depends on. This will help us build a better shared understanding of the current state of digital preservation, and of the wider landscape of information sources that we can all take advantage of and contribute to.

The group identified several barriers that prevent more books from being deposited in digital archives. We then focused on finding or building ways to overcome these challenges, engaging a wide array of key stakeholders along the way.

Our terms of reference were to:

 1. Produce some short, clear guidance for publishers about steps they can take to facilitate digital preservation of books and related metadata
 
 2. Inform the development of the EPUB/A (A=archival) standard

 3. Improve discovery of which books are preserved where

All three strands have moved forward very successfully. We launched a digital preservation guide for publishers in March 2024 (https://clockss.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Clockss_Guide_WEB.pdf), ISO is moving the draft EPUB/A specification through its committee process with the goal of publishing it in draft form by the end of 2024, and an exciting Proof of Concept project has made it possible for publishers to use MARC and ONIX metadata to communicate where their books are preserved. An industry-wide international education campaign is just starting, and we will be able to report on this at the time of the iPres conference.

We'll have a mixed panel of librarians, preservationists, publishers, and intermediaries to share why they got engaged and what worked and didn't. There were some fascinating learning points for all, made possible by listening and engaging respectfully from a wide variety of perspectives.","In a recent panel discussion, we reviewed the outputs from a CLOCKSS-convened group of libraries, publishers, and intermediaries that tackled barriers to digital book deposits.

Research data ecosystems like the HDE provide a central data-discovery portal (similar to a data catalog); however, ecosystem architecture design relies on independently-managed data repositories with disparate architectures and governance frameworks. These types of systems tend not to fit neatly into existing digital sustainability frameworks such as the NDSA Levels of Preservation. In addition, most digital preservation literature tends to focus on the sustainability of *centralized* data archives rather than *distributed* data ecosystems. We propose that the sustainability of distributed research ecosystems may be evaluated by integrating concepts from existing digital preservation assessment frameworks standards that, in combination, address many of the digital sustainability factors that apply to organizational, repository, and dataset levels of granularity within a distributed system. We experiment with two such possible frameworks. First, the Digital Preservation Coalition’s Rapid Assessment model includes several metrics that cover organizational/repository *architecture and governance* and could be extended to apply to a distributed data ecosystem. Second, the relatively recent FAIR data principles provide guidance for evaluating ecosystem practices at the *dataset level*. This exploratory paper aims to spark discussion and additional research around how best to create and implement efficient frameworks for evaluating digital sustainability in a data ecosystem that depends on non-centralized architecture and governance.","Distributed research data ecosystems, like the NIH HEAL Data Ecosystem, lack a unified framework for evaluating their sustainability.

Introducing a Preservability Self Assessment Tool,2024-03-15 20:13:53.853500+00:00,Workshop,Monday Workshops,Approaches to Preservation,From document to data,"This workshop invites attendees to experiment with a new Self Assessment Tool that identifies preservability risk factors for complex works and offers recommendations to content creators that could improve their project’s preservation outlook. The workshop is for anyone preserving complex works (or interested in doing so) that may need to assess their preservability. It is especially relevant to those who interface with content creators and have opportunities to give feedback to improve preservation outcomes - for example, those working with digital humanities researchers.

The tool is being developed from five years of research into the preservability of new forms of scholarship (i.e., complex works characterized by the variety of digital enhancements such as audio, video, data visualizations, nonlinear navigation, etc., that are integrated alongside or in lieu of text). For this research, preservation experts [worked with publishers/platforms][1] and [evaluated complex publications][2] to determine their risk factors for preservability. From this they suggested [interventions (“Guidelines”) to reduce risks][3] based on preservation method (web archiving, export etc.) and format. 

The research identified a need to share advice about improving preservability of scholarship with content creators in an actionable way. The Self Assessment Tool aims to meet this need. The tool uses a process workflow that unfolds over several conversations. It includes a set of questions and access points into the Guidelines.

The workshop will start with a short introduction to the Self Assessment Tool, highlighting scenarios from the research that illustrate features that can be difficult to preserve alongside relevant guidance for those scenarios. In small groups, participants will then test facets of the tool working through questions, identifying risks, and mapping them to suggested interventions from the Guidelines. Attendees are encouraged to bring their own examples of scholarly works with preservation challenges and to explore the Guidelines, considering how they might be implemented to improve preservability. 

Finally, team members will lead a conversation about attendees’ experiences working with the tool, seeking insights into areas for improvement, and an understanding of how useful the tool could be for the communities with whom they work.

Regarding institutional repositories, the guarantee of the longevity of digital content is most often weakened by the lack of this documentation. Therefore, we understand that Distributed Digital Preservation is a reliable alternative to mitigating the lack of policies and other risk agents. This paper presents an overview of digital preservation policies in institutional repositories of the LOCKSS networks community. This article identified the structure and grip of digital preservation policies to ISO 14721 and 16363 standards guidelines. Eleven LOCKSS networks were identified, 610 partner institutions were investigated, resulting in the identification of 184 institutional repositories and 40 digital preservation policy documents. Digital Preservation Policy is an essential document so that the promise of guaranteeing the longevity of digital objects stored in the Institutional Repository can be fulfilled. In this context, using the framework structure for digital preservation policies, identified on the websites of institutions in the LOCKSS networks, expands the scope of the domain of managing the preservation of digital content in Institutional Repositories.","Digital preservation policies serve as a connection between the preservation ecosystem and digital management, yet many institutional repositories suffer from inadequate documentation that threatens the longevity of their digital content.

If we are to improve digital preservation practice, knowledge, funding and awareness, we must broaden our understanding of the current state of digital preservation in self-funded and other low-resource contexts. 
This paper presents a detailed case study of one such context, the state of digital preservation knowledge and practice within the UK professional artist population. Contrary to public belief, artists constitute a highly educated but severely underfunded profession. At the same time, artists in contemporary practice are largely dependent for their professional survival upon the competent and sustainable preservation and use of fragile and valuable digital objects. However, training and sociotechnical support infrastructure for this professional domain is conspicuous by its absence. 
These tensions make contemporary professional art practice an ideal site for investigation of the barriers to - and benefits of - improved digital preservation practice.  
This paper provides an overview of current digital preservation practice in this complex professional landscape; delivers practical recommendations for consideration by the digital preservation community; and demonstrates the value of interdisciplinary research in understanding the real barriers to digital preservation – and how we may lower them - in a fascinating and often misunderstood profession.

This paper outlines the findings of this endeavor. After a brief introduction and summary on the emergence of text and instant messaging as pivotal communication tools, we first assess their suitability for policy-making dialogue. Then follows an exploration of the preservation challenges the medium presents, both in a general context and specifically within Belgium, and of some strategies that can be employed to mitigate these challenges.

 There's been an Oops. Big or small. It doesn’t matter. What does matter is that, with the benefit of hindsight, it could have been avoided. And to make it worse, someone just shared the immortal line “I could have told you that would happen.”

This panel session is intended to surface as many of those “Oops! If only…” scenarios as possible, and then let the panel/audience decide which of these are the most important to be aware of for those **Starting 2 Preserve** .

We see this as an interactive panel session utilising the expertise of up to 7 authorities from the field of Digital Preservation and related disciplines. Each will be asked to briefly put forward an anecdote / point of view / opinion relating to most important nugget of Digital Preservation wisdom they wish they’d known before they started. The statements will be followed by a series of questions designed to explore those scenarios further. 

The audience will be invited to participate (and contribute their own “if only...” scenarios) through a series of questions/observations from the floor (both those in attendance and those attending virtually). In particular, the audience will be polled at the end of the session to see what they think is(are) the most important thing(s) the past can warn future Digital Preservation practitioners about.

This is the third in a series of panel discussions that have taken place it iPres over the past two years. Although presented in a light hearted fashion, we see this as a particularly useful way of surfacing the common pitfalls experienced by those taking their first steps into Digital Preservation that could have been avoided… if only someone had told them.

The DPC/TNA Novice to Know-How course and its ongoing development is a salient example. This poster uses interactive and asynchronous engagement to call on digital preservation community educators and policymakers to include individuals and community groups when developing “start 2 preserve” initiatives. This poster’s call is supported with empirical findings that contribute to the emerging issue of democratizing digital preservation skills amongst these groups in the UK. 

Using in-poster links to audiovisual evidence, the poster presents findings from two doctoral, qualitative, research projects. One project researched self-tracking personal digital archives, and the other researched activist community web archives. The first project used mobile and virtual data collection methods, researching eight members of the public who used self-tracking records to create personal digital archives of their running history. The second project used interviews and participant diaries to understand the engagement of UK activist-archives with web archiving also including data from Documenting the Now, the UK Web Archive and the Community Archives and Heritage Group. 

The poster discusses the findings in relation to the need to democratize digital preservation skills. Activist archives recognise the need for digital preservation skills but there is a skills gap for runners' personal digital archives. Runners often lack digital preservation knowledge and rely on third-party platforms. Both studies highlighted the need to empower individuals and activist communities to preserve digital content beyond commercial platforms through educational resources and capacity building. Empowerment through democratized digital preservation education could enable individuals and activist communities to make informed choices about their digital legacies and respect their agency to contribute to safeguarding further a shared digital heritage for future generations. 

This poster, with asynchronous digital learning tools, provides new knowledge about the digital preservation skills from the UK public and activist community groups. The poster wants to open a conversation with the international digital preservation community to help those wanting to get started with digital preservation to meet their personal and community digital archive needs.","Over the past ten years, there has been a significant move in the UK towards enhancing the digital preservation skills of staff in collecting institutions, exemplified by the DPC/TNA Novice to Know-How course.

Their knowledge can provide valuable insights into sustainable living and adaptation strategies that are crucial in the face of global climate change. Owing to the risk of losing oral history and indigenous knowledge due to climatic changes and displacements resulting from conflicts in the Northeast of Nigeria, this study set out with the overall aim of creating a condition where indigenous knowledge is digitized and is securely maintained for the present and future generations. This attempt was made through the assessment of organisational capacity of Ramat Library by utilising the Digital Preservation Coalition Rapid Assessment Model (DPC RAM). This research proposes using the six elements of the DPC RAM as a basis for beginning the evaluation and progression towards sustainable digital preservation of indigenous knowledge regarding climate change adaptation. The Ramat Library at the University of Maiduguri was utilized for the practical application. The findings in this paper shows that there are fundamental issues hampering the digital preservation of indigenous knowledge. Some of these issues are policy related, lack of technical literacy by library staff members and poor collaboration between Library and wider community amongst others.","The literature emphasizes the significance of digitally archiving indigenous knowledge related to climate change, as these communities hold unique insights into resource management and environmental adaptation.

Long-term negative maintenance of legacy systems threatens the security and availability of historical data, and also brings economic and technical burdens. In the Chinese context, this article first concludes the requirements triangle which means the public sectors' need to rescue historical data of legacy systems lies in three aspects: data long-term preservation, data used as evidence and data sharing and utilization. Based on a review of the relevant literature, this paper categorizes the existing approaches related to legacy systems into a two-dimensional matrix with four quadrants according to the degree of technological and functional change. Building on these approaches, and in order to further meet the requirements triangle, this article suggests a Chinese solution - data archiving, which is based on China's institutional background and archive management demands. Data archiving incorporates the comprehensive archives into the process of solving legacy system problems, takes advantage of the expertise of archives in long-term preservation of resources, and finally satisfies the requirements triangle. It can be concluded that the practice of data archiving simultaneously brings value to organizations plagued by legacy systems, to comprehensive archives and to the data itself.","In the digital transformation era, preserving historical data from legacy systems is crucial yet challenging due to the risks of inadequate maintenance.

In fact, electronic records are encoded in the most diverse file formats (text, still images, audio and video recordings, technical records and many other digital media formats), but they are bound to become rapidly obsolete (and in some cases already are) and need to be converted from one file format to another in order to preserve the authenticity, reliability, integrity and usability of such records as evidence of business functions, processes, activities and transactions.

Consequently, the challenge of identifying when file formats need to be converted, which formats to choose for conversion, and which approaches to apply from an operational point of view begins to emerge.

However, despite being theorized as one of the most successful digital preservation solutions, format conversion has not yet been sufficiently practiced. Even when the need to transfer electronic records from an obsolete format to a more modern one is adequately felt, the process is often delayed due to a lack of knowledge and expertise, as well as a lack of clear and precise guidelines and advice on how to carry out the conversion, including technical and operational methods.

This paper aims to address this issue by referring both to the international standards and guidelines and on the Italian “Guidelines on the creation, management and preservation of electronic documents”, issued by the Italian Agency for Digital Government (in particular with reference to”) and in particular will focus on the operational methodology for file format conversion contained in Annex 2 “File formats and conversion”","The conversion of file formats is essential for maintaining the integrity and usability of digital records, as many formats quickly become outdated.

How interesting then, that in the past decade, numerous independent initiatives in at least ten different countries have organically sprung up to fill this void. In every case, it's a small team, even a single person, whose passion for local history and archival photographs, and knowledge of web development, has led them to digitize historical photos, develop digital heritage portals, and create communities revolving around local history and collective memory. These cooperative history portal initiatives are surprisingly technologically innovative–offering sophisticated timeline, mapping, geolocation, crowd-source tagging, search/exploration, public discussion, and photo-matching tools that allow people from a particular place or country to explore historical photos most relevant to them, and to add their local expertise. These initiatives are also refreshingly innovative in terms of user experience and aesthetics, and have much to teach digital preservation communities about increasing and enlivening public engagement with historical photos.

However, in aggregate the bulk of cultural heritage materials, including those in digital form, are held by the tens of thousands of smaller organizations dedicated to preserving local memory collections such as public libraries, historical societies, regional museums, and community archives. These smaller organizations are also more focused on preserving the lives and accomplishments of everyday citizens and local history -- collection building that greatly diversifies the archival record well beyond the institutional self-documentation or collections of famous/entitled people that tend to characterize the collections of larger organizations.

It has moved away from using an on-premise Electronic Document and Records Management System (EDRMS) with data stored on network and personal drives; to a cloud-based Office 365 environment with the teams from both Houses storing and sharing data in OneDrive and SharePoint. This move created a need for a solution to transferring information of archival value out of its cloud based collaborative platform and into long-term storage and preservation whilst retaining the context within which they were created.
Transfer of information is complicated by the nature of cloud-based collaboration and storage in several ways. Firstly, when files can be viewed, edited, stored and shared by multiple users concurrently, it can be difficult to establish what the authoritative version of a file is. Secondly, with the proliferation of user applied metadata tags and labels, the context in which the files were created form as much a part of the archival record as the files themselves. Thirdly, there is the question of how to validate and authenticate files extracted from the cloud.
The preservation of this data moves away from preserving just the individual file to capturing the file and its contextual metadata. This paper describes the Parliamentary Archives efforts to explore and test the transfer and authentication archival data from the cloud and into their digital repository.","Since 2020, the UK Parliament has shifted to cloud-based operations, transitioning from an on-premise Electronic Document and Records Management System to an Office 365 environment using OneDrive and SharePoint for data management. This change necessitated a method for transferring archival information from the cloud to long-term storage while preserving its contextual integrity. The challenge lies in identifying authoritative versions of files, understanding metadata's role in archiving, and ensuring the authenticity of cloud-extracted data, which the Parliamentary Archives are actively addressing.",Emily Chen,Emily Chen,"Nicole Hartland, Rosemary Reynolds",https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/d18g1vbe/,,https://doi.org/10.21428/5676bf2d.d7c827b0,2024-09-18,12:00,25 minutes,,concerthall,Architecture of Digital Preservation Systems,https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/3c201d717da7420295f0ae90d0b0b1e9787aeff96d2548fb8552074190b13848,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FD-lIrViKGWNpBR8inlhbkoudzx4OqY7IM5C7anGIn0/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)
indico133,Analyzing Large Web Archive Collections Using Parquet Files,2024-03-18 01:58:12.108476+00:00,Tutorial,Interactive formats,Approaches to Preservation,From document to data,"Web archives continue to grow in cultural heritage organizations around the world.  Improvements in the ability to identify, select, capture and replay these archived web resources are helping many organizations to meet their missions of preservation and access in the digital world.  With this increase of archived web resources, additional methods of analyzing large amounts of data are needed to understand the complexity of these collections and help make accurate preservation decisions about the content.

The Parquet format is an open source, column-oriented data file format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. It has implementations in a variety of programming languages and acts as a standardized way of storing large datasets in many big data and distributed storage and analysis applications. It excels in the storage of tabular data with repeated values that are often queried to identify counts, sums, and unique sets of values. 

To demonstrate the potential for Parquet files to be used in analyzing web archives, we will use the End of Term (EOT) Web Archive as a data testbed for this tutorial. The EOT has been gathering snapshots of the federal web, consisting of the publicly accessible "".gov"" and "".mil"" websites since 2008. In 2022, the End of Term team packaged these crawls into a public dataset which they released as part of the Amazon Open Data Sponsorship Program. In total, over 460TB of WARC data was moved from local repositories at the Internet Archive and the University of North Texas Libraries. The EOT team generated Parquet files for the contents of each term's web crawls to allow for large-scale analysis of content and to answer questions about the data that previously had been challenging or impossible to answer.

In this tutorial we will bring a hands-on experience for the participants to analyze a substantial web archive collection. The tutorial will include introduction to some existing archival collection summarization tools like CDX Summary and Archived Unleashed Toolkit, the process of converting CDX(J) files to Parquet files, numerous SQL queries to analyze those Parquet files for practical and common use-cases, and visualization of generated reports.",,"Mark Phillips, Sawood Alam","Mark Phillips, Sawood Alam",,,,,2024-09-19,11:00,1h 30m,,artiestenfoyer,,,https://docs.google.com/document/d/170qoj-FuFfEnuWsbQPVZTzK88PUp4rAARYXsR4WUD30/edit#heading=h.2sh8zqpg4185,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)

File format identification tools such as DROID and Siegfried use multiple methods to identify file formats, including by extension, by binary signature, and by container signature.

Previous iPres workshops (2018, 2022) have tackled binary signature patterns for file format identification. This interactive workshop will build upon these previous workshops and will explore container-based file format identification and container signatures.

The workshop will help participants gain practical skills in the analysis of complex digital files. There will be a brief recap on binary signatures for file format identification, making this workshop accessible for beginners and experienced practitioners and allowing attendees to become familiar with the workshop themes.

Participants will learn about the various structures of file formats, with a particular emphasis on multi-part formats, and how container signatures are used to identify many of these format types. Tools such as hex editors and file packaging utilities will be demonstrated and used to explore these file formats in more detail.

Participants will learn to recognize the indicators of candidate formats for container signature identification, and will gain an understanding of the structure and syntax of container signatures as used by tools such as DROID and Siegfried.

The workshop will cover research techniques for harvesting file format samples and format specifications that are used to verify findings.

Finally, participants will get hands-on with tools for creating and testing container signatures, and will gain familiarity with the process for submitting their file format research to the PRONOM team.

One, because it’s fun, and two, because this is a story about time travel, collaboration, and rescue. For decades, the Doctor has been traveling through time to perform quirky and creative rescue missions. Like historical datasets, each adventure presents unique challenges, but one thing remains constant: the Doctor works best with others, and the same is true of data rescue, which requires expertise in archives, data, and the related subject matter. Discovering usable, historical data in an archives can feel as delightful and magical as the best episodes of Doctor Who. It can also be as tedious and frustrating as the worst episodes, but like all good science fiction, even the worst bits pose illuminating questions.

How do current concepts of data and scholarship compare to historical ones? How do we find data that wasn’t labeled as data? How do we find data that wasn’t *thought of* as data? Once we find archival data, how do we transform it for reuse and analysis? What can historical data teach us about current best practices for documentation and vice versa?  Our research questions and knowledge structures determine what data will be acquired, how it will be arranged and analyzed, and also through what mechanisms it will be interpreted in the archives. Understanding all of this is integral to understanding how the data can be reused.

This panel discussion will bring together archivists, librarians, and data service specialists to share their experiences finding, stewarding, and using data in archives - the successes, frustrations, discoveries, pitfalls, and unanswered questions. Together, we will explore possible solutions to the challenges of bridging data science and archives such as: identifying search terms that might indicate data; inferring missing context about standard research practices at the time data was collected; finding data in unexpected places like annotations and correspondence; working across datasets while preserving document order and fragile materials; extracting data from handwritten narrative text, symbols, and drawings; working through historical challenges like species names that change over time; and, making human-readable data machine-readable.","Why incorporate Doctor Who and the TARDIS into discussions about archival data? It's an engaging analogy for time travel, teamwork, and rescue missions, much like the Doctor's quirky adventures. These journeys, filled with unique challenges, highlight the importance of collaboration in data rescue—where expertise in archives and related fields is crucial. Ultimately, uncovering historical data can be as enchanting as the best Doctor Who episodes, yet it also raises significant questions about data labeling and transformation for modern analysis.","Bethany Anderson, Poppy Townsend, Sandi Caldrone, Sarah Fox, Shannon Farrell","Bethany Anderson, Mikala Narlock, Poppy Townsend, Sandi Caldrone, Sarah Fox, Shannon Farrell",,,,,2024-09-19,14:00,1 hour,https://zenodo.org/records/13770146,kraakhuis,Panel: Collaborative Efforts to Save Historical Data,https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/da2d1b9b4b1f4d30bdfe6ee2f5e1578774244bbbdd7b4374b3caa268caec75fe,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mghp5CLQs5hveGd3YOoAoi-bIrSSuzckv1-Ta70hiH8/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)

From the NEDLIB project in the 90s of the twentieth century, the worldwide first operational e-Depot in accordance with the OAIS standard in 2002, to important contributions to international research in digital preservation in the first years of the twenty-first century. KBNL shared its successes and knowledge with the digital preservation community by means of papers, professional visits and conferences.

In my opinion, it is of interest to know what the “embodied experience” is like from a practical point of view, and the personal perspective is important because preservation is more than just policy. Although sharing honest stories in public is, unfortunately, not usually an option, we think it’s important to be open to the community about our challenges, and things that have not gone as well as we liked, so we can all learn from those experiences and move forward together.

The process included physical cleaning of disks, and resulted in over 90% of data being recovered and preserved. 

The preservation of born-digital materials begins well before they reach any archival institution. Records created in the 1990s and 2000s are often “saved” on removable storage media by their creators, and the longevity of those media is affected by their storage conditions. Institutions collecting private records must deal with these effects only at the time the records come to us.

In 2023, the Lakehead University Archives began acquiring records donated by Steve Mantis, a long-time activist and advocate for the rights of injured and disabled workers. The records in his fonds reflect close to 40 years of organising. 

Mantis’s records were stored in a hand-built outbuilding on his rural property. This two-story structure serves as a garage and home office, and is not insulated, heated, or air conditioned. There has been no water damage, and excellent air circulation has prevented any mould or mustiness. However, records in the building have been subjected to significant temperature swings (over a possible range of 80 degrees celsius) and insects have not been excluded.

The donation of records included just under 200 floppy disks. Work began with a full cleaning of all disks, including moving and checking under the shutters. Cobwebs and insect remains were removed carefully. Only then was it possible to transfer the information from the disks and prepare SIPs for ingest. Despite the storage environment, most disks were still in good condition. 

Digital preservation may often be talked about in the abstract, but case-studies like this demonstrate the very real material and practical challenges to preservation that are faced by small archives that comprise an important piece of local and regional heritage. This case also demonstrates how removable digital media may be more resilient to temperature extremes and other environmental challenges than one might expect.","This presentation discusses a case study involving the recovery of data from removable digital media stored in subpar conditions within a resource-limited archive. The cleaning process led to the successful recovery of over 90% of the data.

Traditional Circumcision (kaja) practice and ceremony which is a cultural heritage of the Kanuri people of Northeastern Nigeria is a rite of passage for young boys into adulthood. Presently, this practice stands the risk of fading away completely due to the mass displacement resulting from the Boko Haram conflict. The affected indigenous Kanuri communities are on the verge of loosing their sense of place and opportunity to express their cultural values and traditional knowledge. Currently we have tried to use various social media platforms through Communities of Practice to bring elders together and the youth in order to capture and pass this knowledge to the current and future generations. Despite these little efforts, lack of sustainable digital technologies to preserve and ensure accessibility of this knowledge, endangers the knowledge of Kaja. Therefore, there is the urgent need for digital preservation of these practices to salvage the situation before it is too late. 

The traditional circumcision is seen as the foundation for fostering lifetime unity and brotherhood amongst boys. This practice is associated with social cohesion of boys of the same age who become circumcised at the same time.
Through this rite, young boys are taught peacebuilding and how to live in harmony with other communities
The rites performed serves as a prayer for unhindered success for the boys throughout their lifetime.


Although there are several changes witnessed over the years due to modernisation and the recent insurgency, the study found that the core philosophy has remained intact at least within the elders. This knowledge can however die with these elders if concrete actions are not taken to preserve them. It is imperative to digitally preserve these knowledges and performances to make them accessible to displaced Kanuri people and the future generations.","Globally, conflicts jeopardize the sustainability of cultural heritage. The traditional circumcision (kaja) of the Kanuri people in Northeastern Nigeria is a vital rite of passage, now at risk due to Boko Haram-induced displacement.

The US Government Publishing Office, GPO, is the only organization in the the United States to be named as a Trustworthy Digital Repository under ISO 16363:2012 Space data and information transfer systems -- Audit and certification of trustworthy digital repositories and certification under CoreTrustSeal, a peer-reviewed form of repository assessment. Currently, GovInfo ingests an average of 6,000 Submission Information Packages (SIPs) of Federal Government information content per week from over 25 Government organizations and authors. GovInfo collections include born-digital publications and government information published as early as 1789. GovInfo has over 3,393,462 Archival Information Packages of digital Government information objects. These packages contain more than 11.6 million individual PDF files, 30 million images, audio files, spreadsheets, and more. In FY23, over 195 thousand packages were added to GovInfo. The approximate volume of all AIP content is 99 TB. Depending on the complexity of the packages submitted for ingest, processing normally takes less than 5 minutes per package. In FY23, the repository received an estimated 1,1 billion document retrievals from GovInfo.

Through What Means?
GovInfo was established in 2009, prior to the commercial availability of many repository services. GPO has evolved and shaped the repository over time through a series of collection-defined metadata rules, file management operations, processors, and processing mechanisms through a series of micro-services within the overall architectural design of the repository. This poster will feature highlights of this repository design, including newly added tools that allow for multiple types of PDF validation, technical metadata extraction, PII detection, characterization of content, and custom, rule-based parsing of all content. Recent additions to the repository such as the Congressionally Mandated Reports collection highlights how GPO is adding additional machine-readable formats, responding to legislative requirements, and working with federal agencies to increase access to government information. GPO’s team will demonstrate GPO proactively responds to common problems such as file corruption, password protection, image quality, metadata errors, enhanced content description, publication linking, digital signatures, content navigation, among other common problems. Additionally, this poster will feature access points beyond our web interface including RSS, Sitemaps, APIs, and Bulk Data download functionality.","GovInfo, managed by the US Government Publishing Office (GPO), is recognized as a Trustworthy Digital Repository and handles about 6,000 Submission Information Packages weekly from over 25 federal entities.

As such, we need to take steps along that journey, no matter how imperfect, to at least attempt to preserve those objects entrusted to us. For too long we had been frozen on our journey at Ohio State, when confronted with born digital collections at scale; stuck in the binary of how do we describe these collections at the item level to ingest them into our existing digital preservation repository, Digital Collections, or doing nothing at all. We had simply embraced the latter. 
However, in the summer of 2021 we began to scheme the development of a lightweight, cloud-based digital preservation platform that could complement our existing digital preservation repo. One that would be based upon the archival principle of more product, less processing (MPLP). As we began to engage stakeholders, as well as architect, build and test the repository, we actually realized that this new repo was much more in alignment with our collecting and accessioning practices. We were essentially building a digital version of archival and special collections stacks. A digital preservation platform that contains minimally described objects that are tied to their finding aids, where they are discoverable by our users; while being stored in a secure space where only the curators can “wander” just like our secured stacks. Therefore, we have created a “gray” or “dim” repository, which is neither “light” (allows patron access) nor “dark” (essentially no access). Launched in January 2024, the Gray Digital Preservation Repository, is now our default repo for born digital content.
This poster will document the journey we have embarked upon, along with the workflow and tools, open source and proprietary, that we have used to build and sustain this new environment. While acknowledging the privilege of our institution, we feel there are lessons learned from this journey that may benefit institutions of all sizes and resources.","Digital preservation is a continuous endeavor rather than a final goal, requiring consistent efforts to safeguard entrusted objects. At Ohio State, we had been stagnant in our approach to born digital collections until we initiated the creation of a cloud-based preservation platform in summer 2021.

The lore behind our game, which combines a medieval setting with modern, digital technology, is essential to attracting players to the game and contextualizing the purpose and journey motif of the game. 

The story of Dungeons & Documents is set in the Kingdom of Archeion, which is split into five parts: four provinces, and one central Citadel. The Kingdom has entered a new era of peace after a long and brutal war, the ""War for the Cloud"", which began after the discovery of a new magic, which allows any kind of document to be replicated and kept in a ‘cloud’. King Codex III, in an effort to bind the provinces together by shared knowledge and community, has ordered that a chosen archivist be sent from each province bearing their land’s most important and treasured documents. In order to reach the Citadel, the archivists must travel over dangerous terrain full of threats that can weaken and even destroy their precious digital collections. For them to succeed, they must draw upon their knowledge of digital preservation practices so they may triumph over danger and take their place in the Citadel’s Renaissance Library. 

Across the course of the game, players have to keep preserving the three digital objects they have in their possession by doing backups (adding 'lives') and adding metadata (adding value). By linking backups to the common concept of 'lives' from video games and metadata to the concept of value, which is tallied up at the end of the game and which determines the winner, the game manages to incorporate digital preservation terms into game logic. Through the use of these simplified concepts and the journey motif, the game communicates the following basic digital preservation principles: the ongoing nature of digital preservation, the importance of backups, as well as the fact that the more metadata an object has, the more valuable it is.",,"Ellen Fanning, Feargal Keenan","Ellen Fanning, Feargal Keenan, Lena Boese",,,,,2024-09-18,13:35,20 minutes,,artiestenfoyer,,,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TECjLA7x-Wy1GeVBzuw5jjqsObbotGkgJbFvOfm-kpo/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po,Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)

A relatively young field with practitioners and researchers setting research agendas and finding their way, digital preservation increasingly has been considered an essential aspect of work in the information professions – with substantial input from the fields of libraries, archives, and museums. This poster is intended for both new and seasoned researchers and practitioners interested in reflecting on the changes in the field, focusing on 2012 to the present day; it can serve as a benchmark as the field looks to the future. Participants will explore perspectives on changes in digital preservation over the past 10+ years and their implications for current and future practice.

In 2014, the first edition of Digital Preservation for Libraries, Archives, and Museums was published, following two years of research and writing. A second edition was researched in 2015-16. As writing is completed in 2023-24 on the third edition, this poster reflects on eight major changes in thinking about digital preservation that we have observed: 1) Technology/Systems; 2) Standards and “best practices”; 3) Environmental sustainability; 4) Funding and financial; 5) Supporting marginalized communities: 6) Community, collaboration, and consortial models; 7) Research; 8) Training and education. This poster will focus on these eight topics; as described below. We will be using graphical means when possible to present these ideas and to explore potential implications.","The landscape of digital preservation has evolved significantly since the inaugural iPRES conference in 2004, becoming integral to the information professions, particularly in libraries, archives, and museums.

Initially, the project aimed to address both dissemination and long-term preservation needs. Yet, following the tender process, the implemented service is solely oriented towards preservation. Consequently, ACOUA is a ‘dark’ archive, accessible only to authenticated users. This makes it challenging to communicate to researchers the full value of the service.

Overall, ACOUA enables to instate robust and OAIS-compliant workflows from data ingestion and curation to audit and retrieval, backed by detailed documentation and dedicated support for end-users. 
However, feedback from researchers emphazises the crucial importance of '[FAIRification][2]' for preserved objects.

This poster outlines the challenges encountered, strategies applied, and effective solutions implemented to meet the FAIR principles. 

Highlingts of the state-of-the-art include: 
 

FINDABLE 

A locally developed DataCite v.4.4 metadata generator streamlines the process of adding the metadata files to preserved objects. 

 
ACCESSIBLE 

Each preserved object is assigned a unique DataCite DOI. 
Pre-signed URLs enable the public access to datasets from ACOUA.
A specially developed connector facilitates the automatic transfer of datasets from ACOUA to Zenodo. 

 
INTEROPERABLE 

Currently, we maintain a basic OAI-PMH repository. 


REUSABLE 

Licenses and readme files are mandatory in ACOUA. 
DROID characterization and JHOVE validation of file formats are integrated into the process. 
A checksum check ensures the integrity of retrieved objects. 

 
Nevertheless, more needs to be done to reach full FAIRness. 
The poster also introduces new developments being considered for future work. Examples include, but are not limited to: 

Use features of the preservation tool to convert files to open formats at ingestions time (SIP), or to prevent obsolescence by evolving file formats on AIP/DIP copies. 
Explore existing ontologies for specific data collections within ACOUA. 
Integrate the linked data version of PRONOM, when available. 

Our ultimate goal is to establish ACOUA as a '[FAIR over time][3]' and trustworthy repository, for an enlarged community of re-users.

Such loss includes the more than 11.000 glass plate negatives that documented the academic and scientific history of the institution. After the accident, the Memory and Archive Section of the museum (SEMEAR) took over the iconographic items of the extinct Photography Section, including a series of 219 cardboard with collages of printed photographs. After the archivist treatment, the cardboards were digitized, according to Brazilian norms for digital preservation. The following analyses revealed that part of these photographic cardboards represent printed samples of the lost glass plate negatives, constituting the last physical evidence of the lost collection. This highlights the importance of the preservation of this material and your scientific dissemination to promote the knowledge, the safeguard of the national memory and to offer full access to the general public.

The RM department oversees the digital preservation of government records transferred to NAS. In general, preservation-related decisions are currently recorded by the department in the following manner:
 
1.     Formal documentation containing instructions or high-level policy tailored for communication to government agencies. – Only major decisions are generally recorded while minor decisions and contextual information deemed unsuitable or irrelevant for external communication are usually excluded.
 
2.     Emails documenting decisions on specific activities or actions. – Easily lost as emails accumulate over time and emails containing decisions are mingled with emails which do not.
 
To ensure that there is a more structured framework to document decisions, NAS is currently piloting a documentation framework for digital preservation. Decisions made during preservation activities are recorded using a template based on the Architectural Decision Record (ADR) methodology. Where a decision is important enough that a higher-level policy or workflow document must be updated, this update is also recorded using a template based on ADR.
 
By implementing such a framework, NAS hopes to,
 
Implement preservation plans more consistently without duplication of work,
Improve governance and accountability for decision making,
Ensure institutional knowledge is retained, allowing new staff to learn and understand past decisions.
 
An important aspect of this pilot is to try and minimise the number of changes required to existing practices to not disrupt current operations. Existing documentation will be incorporated, while recording of operational decisions will carry on more intentionally and moved from email to ADR-based templates.
 
This lightning talk describes this pilot documentation framework for digital preservation and takeaways from the experience so far.","In preparation for its digital preservation system launch, the Records Management department at the National Archives of Singapore is evaluating current practices to enhance scalability.

This talk explores a collaborative initiative undertaken by a consortium of NSW Government cultural institutions to develop a system-agnostic Submission Information Package (SIP) specification as part of a broader digital preservation pilot project. The objective was to establish a unified framework that supports interoperability across diverse organisations while accommodating unique preservation requirements and metadata standards of each institution as part of a shared digital preservation solution.

Leveraging standards such as the Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS), PREservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (PREMIS), and the Bagit File Packaging Format, the project aimed to create a common SIP specification that could integrate seamlessly with any existing or future digital preservation system infrastructure. The development process involved comprehensive stakeholder analysis, requirement gathering, iterative design, and pilot testing with datasets from participating institutions. Several revisions were made to the original specification to better align with practical challenges and feedback from participating institutions. This iterative refinement process was crucial to ensuring that the specification could effectively handle the diverse nature of digital content and metadata practices across different institutions.

How can we use conversational AI to create engaging and immersive experiences that bring the past to life? How can we design narratives that are faithful to the archival sources, but also adaptable to the interests and needs of the users? How can we leverage the rich audiovisual material in the archives, without resorting to long and boring texts? 
These are some of the questions that we will explore in this interactive workshop, where participants will learn how to use conversational AI to create dialogues with the past.

The workshop will consist of three parts:
·	A brief introduction to the concept and potential of conversational AI in archives, with examples from VRT's projects and experiments.
·	A hands-on session where participants will work in groups to design and prototype conversational AI scenarios for different archival contexts, such as news, Video/audio-on-demand platforms, and education.
·	A plenary discussion where participants will share and reflect on their prototypes, and receive feedback from the workshop facilitators and other participants.

The workshop is aimed at anyone who is interested in exploring the possibilities of conversational AI in archives, whether they are archivists, researchers, journalists, educators, or storytellers. No prior technical or design skills are required, only curiosity and creativity.

The database was created with Paradox system and stored locally on a personal laptop IBM ThinkPad R40e, a model released by IBM in October 2003 and discontinued year after in October 2004. The database has never had a front-end. Access to data was provided by paper print outs sent by Michael by mail. Although archival science dictates that we should always preserve the records in the way they were used this approach will not serve well our current archive community. We are now considering different ways of preserving the datasets: 

 - Reverse engineering approach – aimed at preserving the data and the way on which it was accessed. Is it important to preserve the way the data was used? The database has never had a front-end. Access to data was provided by paper print outs.
 - Content-centred approach – focus on content of the tables and migration of data into open format (CSV, evaluate SIARD).

But how can workflows within a consortium with several institutions be represented and handled? The poster describes how existing workflows from different institutions can be combined and linked. 
In the LaVaH consortium twelve Hessian universities and unversities of applied sciences work together with the headquarters of the hebis library network for a common digital preservation network of digital data in Hesse. Based on a distributed infrastructure, the local data curators are responsible for curating and selecting objects for preservation and creating the submission information packages (SIP). The archiving process is carried out centrally by the hebis headquarters.
The institutions have different types of data that need to be archived. There are also different collections within an institution, which come from different sources and go through their own workflows in the run-up to long-term archiving. Different ingest formats are defined for the respective collections, i.e. the form in which the submission information packages (SIP) are packed and the format in which the metadata is delivered. Accordingly, the processes and tools that accompany the path from existing data and metadata to a SIP are different. Various tools are used at the institutions, e.g. for digitizing historical sources. It therefore makes sense to exchange about the partners' approach and to check if existing routines and tools can be reused by other institutions. 
To achieve a structured overview of the various processes and workflows all partners are asked to describe the workflows in their companies, as well as to identify who is responsible and name the tools used. The results are presented in an internal workshop.
The poster describes the different workflows with possible overlaps and interfaces on the one hand and the process towards a common understanding and representation on the other.","Documenting workflows within a single institution is already a complex task, so managing them across a consortium of multiple institutions presents an even greater challenge.

SAM-FS is soon reaching ""EOL"". The NLN has recently developed a front-end software solution called DPS (Digital Preservation Services). DPS uses HPSS from IBM as underlying bit-repository. DPS/HPSS is intended to replace SAM-FS as the preservation solution for digital objects. DPS requires that all objects must be delivered with associated checksums. 

In the old SAM-FS bit-repository, many objects lack checksums, especially material from the first years of its use. All objects in SAM-FS are stored in 3 instances. If differences were to be uncovered between the 3 instances, there are no checksums to verify which instance is correct. The total amount of data to be migrated from SAM-FS to DPS is approximately 14 Petabytes. It is estimated that about 1/3 of these data lacks checksums. 

**Challenge**: How could we ensure that objects migrated from SAM-FS to DPS are the same as those originally archived in SAM-FS when original checksums do not exist? 

**How we solved it:** Based on access to multiple instances of the preserved objects, stored on different media in SAM-FS, we created a workflow that migrated objects from SAM-FS to DPS using checksums pre-generated from the tape instance to verify the disk instance. This ensured that the migrated data was considered ""authentic"" relative to the time it was submitted to the SAM-FS bit-repository. 

**Result**: So far, we have re-archived 3 Petabyte. Generating checksums has prevented data loss in the migration process in one specific case. We experienced that a number of files we read from the disk copy in SAM-FS had incorrect checksums. It turned out that one of the archive disk systems had a corrupt file system after an unexpected shutdown. The way we had created and stored checksums before starting the migration allowed us to quickly discover that there was something wrong with many files to be migrated. If we hadn't had these pre-generated checksums and just relied on reading the disk copy from SAM-FS, generating checksums, and then sending the object to DPS, data would have been lost.","The National Library (NLN) has utilized SAM-FS (Oracle HSM) for digital storage since 2007, but it is nearing its end of life. To address this, NLN developed a new software solution, DPS (Digital Preservation Services), which employs HPSS from IBM for storage. DPS will take over as the preservation method for digital objects and requires all objects to have associated checksums. However, many items in the legacy SAM-FS system lack checksums, particularly from its early years, complicating data verification given that all objects are stored in three instances. To ensure authenticity during migration, a workflow was created that used checksums generated from tape instances to verify the disk instances. So far, 3 Petabytes have been re-archived, and the checksum process has proven crucial in identifying corrupt files, preventing potential data loss.","Thomas Edvardsen, Trond Teigen","Thomas Edvardsen, Trond Teigen",,https://zenodo.org/records/13681583,,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13681583,2024-09-19,13:35,5 minutes,https://zenodo.org/records/13681583,concerthall,The Constraints When Scaling Up Preservation Efforts,https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/fac102093df84a8c93031824fad34cd95d7f83fd04574b0884545e07bee9e47f,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lDWYct0heJztUyK5nOaDaLFRBO-Yx4PXT5URfiK3xZo/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)

Our Transfer Digital Records (TDR) service allows depositors to upload records from a network drive environment. However, an increasing number of users (c86% of UK public record bodies) now use cloud ecosystems, mostly SharePoint but also Google drive. Our current digital transfer process requires users to extract records from the cloud before transfer (through re-upload to the cloud). This is slow, inefficient, error-prone and, most importantly, can disrupt or lose metadata (particularly dates). It also introduces challenges in selecting export formats. A significant volume of records are affected – both current records and legacy data that has been migrated to the cloud. Scalability is essential.

This lighting talk will describe a feasibility study into enabling users to send records directly from depositors’ SharePoint services to the Archive, quickly, securely and without loss of metadata or file integrity. The study engaged with external partners including Microsoft.

Criteria for maintaining integrity were identified:
•	Transfer user is clearly identified throughout the process
•	Transfer consignments are identified and tracked
•	Users can select which records to transfer
•	The Archive can securely access only selected records
•	Comprehensive metadata is harvested without disruption
•	Metadata is in a form suitable for ingest into archival systems
•	Files are harvested and uploaded to the Archive for ingest
•	Harvesting triggers AWS step-functions which automatically initiate archival processing
•	User administration, registration and compliance policies are met
•	Security and accessibility standards are met

The study identified implementation options including full or minimal integration with a 3rd party app and bespoke development. The talk will outline the options and discuss some outstanding questions which we continue to explore:

•	Research into usability and adoption rates
•	Research into how depositors organise SharePoint metadata

However, our records transfer process (using hard drives) has historically been slow and error-prone. Depositors struggle with technically demanding requirements for preparation and characterisation of digital records. We offer guidance and training but we need to do more.

In 2020 we embarked on the development of a cloud-based service for digital transfer. The new service, ‘Transfer Digital Records’ or TDR, helps UK Government departments upload, prepare and transfer custody of digital public records to TNA for permanent preservation and access. TDR addresses pain points for depositors, removing the need to install digital preservation tools client-side, eliminating metadata spreadsheets, and reducing back-and-forth of records. TDR delivers a more complete, better-structured and more timely record to the archive.

TDR allows transferring departments to upload records via a browser, it performs automated checks including checksums (compared before and after upload), metadata extraction, file format identification and virus scanning. The interface lets users add custom metadata and describe sensitivities and access conditions.

TDR is being built following Agile principles. Our Users are central to the design of the service. We conducted a thorough Discovery (proof-of-concept) followed by a fast Alpha (functional prototype), testing with users all the way. TDR is being built in the open - our code is available for re-use. We’re happy to discuss how others might integrate elements of TDR into their workflows.

The initial service was released in public Beta in April 2023 and has already made it easier and faster to transfer records. We are seeing daily small transfers of digital records to the archive, allowing us to move away from large batches towards a ‘little and often’ principle which brings records into the safety of the archive much earlier.

We are working to widen our scope to accept records directly from cloud ecosystems such as SharePoint or Google. We also wish to increase automated processing to help our users, for example, by detecting (near-)duplicates of records already in the archive or flagging potentially sensitive content. This poster showcases the TDR journey and explores future challenges.","The National Archives (UK) has been archiving digital records for over two decades, but the transfer process has been slow and often problematic.

indico188,Preserving digital news by partnering with newspapers and their platforms,2024-05-09 17:08:37.084995+00:00,Poster,Remote presenters track,Approaches to Preservation,Scaling up,"After researching the digital news preservation landscape in the USA, Portico identified a potential gap. While libraries and archives have strategies for preserving print newspapers, hyper-local digital newspapers are less likely to be preserved. This is at a time of rapid loss of hyper-local print news and an increased dependence on digital-only news.

A mechanism for preserving digital news is web archiving, but due to the rapid turnover of stories on news websites, it can be difficult to visit the site frequently enough to capture every article. Some newspapers provide RSS feeds, but not all, and it can be difficult to detect corrected articles in these feeds. Other newspapers implement a subscription model and cannot be harvested without a special arrangement. Some newspapers are aggregated into larger databases, but these often don’t include the smallest digital-only platforms and are for-profit subscription services that may not be preserved by a third party.

Portico is a community-supported dark archive for scholarly material that forms agreements and works with publishers to preserve their content. Based on this research, Portico initiated a pilot to determine if digital news articles could be managed in a similar way to journal articles. Portico partnered with a single newspaper and worked with their content management system provider to retrieve an XML export of every article. The XML and supporting files (photos etc.) were successfully ingested into the archive and were similar to journal articles. To confirm if this was repeatable, Portico worked with another newspaper on the same platform and reused the workflow with few changes.

Portico is repeating this experiment with two more newspapers on different platforms. If the content can be archived from each, Portico will seek to expand the work and develop a business model to support a broader effort in digital news preservation. An early step will be to reach out to the ~3000 newspapers on the platforms that have already been configured.

For the poster, the author will share details of the process used for this project and seek feedback from the community about the value of this approach for preserving digital news.","After examining digital news preservation in the USA, Portico found that hyper-local digital newspapers are often neglected despite the decline of print news. Web archiving is a potential solution, but capturing every article is challenging due to the frequent updates on news sites. While some newspapers offer RSS feeds, not all do, and subscription models can hinder access. Portico, a scholarly dark archive, has begun a pilot project to archive digital news articles similarly to journal articles, successfully collaborating with a newspaper to retrieve and store their content. The initiative is ongoing with more newspapers, aiming to establish a sustainable model for preserving digital news.",Karen Hanson,Karen Hanson,,https://zenodo.org/records/13621505,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xu-LQuCz3VM38X_sEVfOhBzXE5qMFyRW/view?usp=drive_link,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13621505,2024-09-17,13:35,10 minutes,,suite,Scaling up!,,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bukG4bEvICUzC-Fp3KAcHmq2wRuqU8x67PRAuX-RwR4/,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)

Preservationists need comprehensive information about datasets' creation, relevance, and long-term value to support informed preservation decisions. Our proposed solution is to involve data curators in appraisal for preservation early in the dataset deposit processing order to capture the richest possible understanding of a dataset’s current and perceived long-term usefulness. By leveraging their unique position working with depositors, curators can collect essential information to inform preservation decisions and reduce duplication of effort in (re)appraisal over time. 

In this poster presentation, we will share recent efforts to finalize and publish an appraisal checklist to be used by data curators at the point of ingest, in their interactions with depositors, and then later, by preservationists during a (re)appraisal process. Join us to explore how integrating long-term appraisal into data curation can ensure better decision-making by preservationists over the long-term, minimizing environmental costs and duplication of effort while also preparing better for changes in ongoing research needs.","As the volume and complexity of research data increase, the need for effective long-term access to valuable datasets becomes more critical.

One of meemoo’s core objectives is digitising endangered audio-visual heritage. Since 2013, meemoo has been working together with 10 regional broadcasters to safeguard their archives. From 2013 to 2020, we mainly prioritised the digitisation of analog archives, focussing on video tapes such as Betacam SP. In these digitisation projects, meemoo stuck to a certain procedure where the regional broadcasters prepared the tapes by barcoding, cataloguing and packaging, while the digitisation itself was executed by an external service provider, and the digital files were archived into the meemoo archive. In 2021 we set up a unique project for the digital transfer of a specific digital carrier format used mainly by regional broadcasters in Flanders: the professional disc or XDCAM, where the regional broadcaster functioned as both content and service provider.

XDCAM, a video carrier using optical disc, was in use by Flemish regional broadcasters from approx. 2007 until as recent as 2019. The aim of meemoo’s digital transfer project was to ensure the sustainable preservation of the material stored on these discs for two specific regional broadcasters.

Due to these discs’ unique character  - the use of an optical disc instead of tape - a custom approach which differed from meemoo’s previous digitisation projects was required. For this project we relied on a combination of meemoo’s experience with common digitisation practices and the digital ingest flow, as well as on the technical equipment and knowhow of the regional broadcasters.

The project allowed for the digital transfer and ingest of over 55.000 clips from almost 6000 XDCAM discs for the two regional broadcasters. However, this was not without challenges. From the registration of the carriers, to the transfer process, to the submission and subsequent ingest into the meemoo archival system several hurdles had to be overcome. This gave us valuable insights for the future on how to better approach these types of projects where the carrier lies somewhere on the border between the analogue and the digital.","Meemoo, the Flemish Institute for Archives, is a non-profit organization focused on enhancing the digital archiving capabilities of cultural, media, and governmental entities, particularly by digitizing endangered audio-visual heritage.

Developing a machine-readable and continuously updated registry of preservation policies and actions is critical for a digital preservation repository accommodating diverse resource types and designated user communities. To enhance the automated preservation workflow within the National Digital Preservation Program (NDDP), we conducted a comparative analysis of current technical registries in the digital preservation (DP) community. Our assessment focused on the breadth of format coverage, the completeness of risk factors, the frequency of information updates, and the interoperability. 

Following this evaluation, we selected the Preservation Action Registry (PAR) as the foundation for our implementation framework. We extended PAR ( https://concept.preservica.com/par-browser/home.php ) with descriptive information and example dataset other representative registries and the legacy practices of the NDPP.

This presentation primarily focuses on three key aspects:
1.	**Designing the data model:** We customized the Schema and API of the Preservation Action Registry (PAR) to cater to our internal workflow logic while keeping the universal API.
2.	**Aggregating format risk factors:** We sourced risk factors from reputable repositories such as the Library of Congress's Recommended Format Specifications (RFS), WikiDP, and NARA's preservation framework. Subsequently, we designed NDPP’s format risk quantification formula based on these factors. 
3.	**Implementing dynamic updates:** Our system is capable of dynamically detecting updates from community information sources and triggering preservation activities for relevant archived resources in time.","Creating a dynamic Preservation Technical Registry is essential for managing various digital resources and user needs. We analyzed existing registries to improve the automation of the National Digital Preservation Program's workflow, focusing on format coverage, risk factors, and update frequency.

Subsequently, the functional analysis maps the relevant information, files, metadata, extensions on the metadata model and the trigger for archiving (step 3). In the testing phase (step 4), a small dataset has to be ingested in a testing platform and this test and metadata has to be controlled. Afterwards, an API integration will transfer all the relevant data to the E-depot (step 5). Finally, clients can use the digitally stored information for their daily business processes (step 6) [1].

In the context of these challenges, the Educopia Institute—in partnership with APTrust, Chronopolis, CLOCKSS, lyrasis, MetaArchive, and the Texas Digital Library (six members of the Digital Preservation Services Collaborative)—sought funding from the Institute of Library and Museum Services (IMLS) to reaffirm the need for—and to establish a shared vision for—the sustained viability of values-driven, community-supported approaches to distributed digital preservation (DDP). 

As the project advanced we were reminded that, as technical service providers, we too are embedded in a broader cultural context that is unconsciously biased towards technocentric solutions, or solutions that foreground technological infrastructures and background social infrastructures. Acknowledging that there are technical and non-technical requirements across the information management continuum, our shared service model vision aims to offer two additional services at discrete moments in the institutional decision-making process: “advocacy-as-a-service,” best deployed at the institutional preservation strategy-forming moment; and “readiness-as-a-service,” assisting stewardship organizations that have recently formed their preservation strategy to identify the content, preservation needs, budget realities, etc., as they begin to research the digital preservation services landscape.

Beyond individual organizations, readiness-as-a-service is also a call for collective strategy among values-driven, community-supported bit-level service providers to anticipate and be prepared to respond to change (and to shocks) in a nimble, coordinated, collaborative way.

We think this vision offers an exciting and viable path forward for values-driven, community-supported service providers, and we hope this vision will attract additional service providers and grow our coalition of support.",,"Alicia Wise, Nathan Tallman","Alicia Wise, Courtney Mumma, Jessica Meyerson, Lydia Tang, Nathan Tallman, Ryan Menefee, Sibyl Schaefer",,,,,2024-09-18,14:00,45 minutes,,kabinet,,,https://docs.google.com/document/d/14j9KL-Wssfi8mp6myvyh2e7goPV95ItEC3ZQ2LpiVvw/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)

The project design was based on OAIS and aims to provide an agnostic infrastructure (suitable for any type of digital object) for the long-term preservation of every digital object created by the UNIMI: data from research and - in the future - cultural assets, and administrative documents.
Arkive has a modular infrastructure:
1.            The storage system is based on Swarm Datacore cloud technology (S3). Despite it is usually addressed to cloud storage we chose to maintain the infrastructure on servers owned by university network. This way, there are better guarantees regarding data control from both security and data protection perspectives.
2.            The file system is virtualized through iRODS, making it possible to completely replace the storage (or its parts), both in terms of hardware and technologies, without impacting the archive's structure.
3.            The data management ""engine"" is Archivematica, which allows for the analysis, normalization, packaging, and movement of data into the repository. aTOM is the application currently serving as the archive's catalog/OPAC for its public part.
4.            User access is permitted in read/write mode only in the data transfer zone and can occur through various methods: client, web page, command line, etc. Some of these methods provide advanced functionalities for transferring large amounts of data.
This approach allows for the construction of solutions highly customized considering UNIMI structure and possible economic constraints and thus facilitating the long-term sustainability of this type of activity.
As the project developed, it became clear that Arkive is just one of several centralized facilities for research data management at UNIMI, alongside other platforms like Dataverse and Indaco (the UNIMI’s High-Performance Computing infrastructure). To overcome fragmentation, efforts are underway to integrate these services into a digital ecosystem for research data management.

To this end, guidelines (https://fair-impact.eu/transparency-guidelines & https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10058634) and a prototype are being developed to improve the transparency of, and trust in, repositories. These guidelines help to expose relevant information as metadata at the organisational and object level to facilitate discovery, provide context, and support interoperability. The guidelines will also recommend accompanying evidence to create a sense of trust in the services themselves and service providers with focus put on exposing information about characteristics (e.g. contact information), information that can help to inform a sense or status of trustworthiness (e.g. preservation policy), and information relating to FAIRness of the digital objects held. The guidelines, and an implementation prototype, will establish relevance of the resources for stakeholders and it is essential that they are informed by community-input. 

This poster will give insights on the modelling of the complex relations, the guidelines, and prototype, in order to encourage discussions and collect feedback from communities, including digital repositories, service providers, and users, so that we can ensure that the guidelines meet the needs of all stakeholders. 

Whilst certification for research data repositories exists (e.g. CoreTrustSeal) not all digital object services have an external authority assessing and validating the service provided. Therefore, this model will also support the transparent disclosure of self-declared assertions about functions and activities. This structured and interoperable format of information expression supports harvesting and validation by third parties, which reduces administrative overhead, improves interoperability, and benefits the wider research landscape. 

FAIR assessment of digital objects can be undertaken by anyone, however, a clear understanding of the results of an assessment requires further evidence regarding the assessment process. This is particularly important when assessment metrics are selected or adapted for a disciplinary context. The guidelines will therefore include the exposure of assessment characteristics, such as a FAIR assessment authority, the tool, its creators, and the evidence they hold.

A prototype implementing the guidelines will serve as a proof of concept, illustrating the core functionality and purpose of the guidelines, showcasing mapping, reuse, and validating the evidence.","The FAIR-IMPACT project aims to promote FAIR practices through the development of guidelines and a prototype to enhance repository transparency and trust.

When this is applied to a digital archive, it can be more difficult to ensure that users know what they are accessing prior to viewing it due to the number of ways that digital data can be accessed. Add in the further complication of human remains from a British early medieval cemetery and things get a bit more complicated. The Archaeology Data Service, as a part of the High Speed 2 (HS2) infrastructure project, was tasked with archiving and disseminating data pertaining to the human remains from several cemeteries that were excavated over the course of the project. This talk will discuss the steps that the ADS took to add content advisories and context to digital archives that contained digital objects relating to different individuals.

So how was this done? Each digital archive and digital object that contains data about human remains receives a tag stating what sensitive information it contains. This tag then triggers notifications on the archive metadata page, the object metadata page, and blurs images/3D models where applicable. While this approach works to provide practical information for users, we felt that some digital objects should also be disseminated with additional contextual information. Within the medieval cemeteries excavated as part of HS2, most individuals were not easily identifiable, but we could give as much context as possible to each individual by linking each individual’s photogrammetry model with associated contextual information and excavation photos. This information was provided on an individual level with a specific web page that displayed an interactive 3D model and the associated contextual information. For larger cemeteries, the individuals were also presented spatially by showing their burial locations on a web map with a sidebar that provides the additional contextual information and links to the individual’s information page. The tagging and techniques that were used can be applied more broadly and include instances where harmful language is used for example and we hope to apply what we learned from HS2 to the rest of our archival holdings.","There is a growing necessity to ensure archive users provide informed consent regarding their viewings. Digital archives complicate this process due to diverse access methods, especially when human remains from British early medieval cemeteries are involved.

In response to the growing need for inclusivity within the international digital preservation community, the proposed mini-conference FRiPRES, aims to bridge language barriers and enhance participation among French-speaking professionals. This initiative seeks to serve as a preliminary, French-speaking segment of the larger International iPRES, making the event more appealing to French spoken participants.
FRiPRES offers a platform where French-speaking archivists, librarians, and digital preservationists can engage in meaningful dialogue and exchange knowledge in their native language. By hosting presentations and discussions in French, it will lower linguistic hurdles, fostering understanding and collaboration within the community. This approach not only encourages participation in the FRiPRES sessions but also aims to motivate attendees to remain for the entire duration of iPRES.

**Proposed Agenda**
We propose to organize that francophone event just before the iPres conference on Monday 16/09. 

The afternoon program will feature presentations from prominent figures : 
 - Arnaud HULSTAERT from SMALS will discuss the intricacies of managing
   'ARCHIVING-AS-A-SERVICE'. (https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnaud-hulstaert/)
 - Marion VILLE will share insights from the innovative Vitam project in France. (https://www.linkedin.com/in/marion-ville-10a96546/ )

We envisage the involvement of institutions as the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF) and a notable organization from Quebec to enriches the discourse. A public call for participation can also be organized for this event of the iPres conference.

**Infotel involvement dedicated to the community:**  
Infotel will sponsor this event, participants will enjoy complimentary food (fries) and beverages, ensuring a comfortable and conducive environment for learning. Infotel will also organize the agenda and manage the activities for this half-day event, facilitating a seamless and engaging experience for all. 
Additionally, FRiPRES will be accessible to a broader audience through the provision of original presentations alongside translated slides, ensuring that the insights and knowledge shared are not confined by language barriers. This strategic dissemination of content aims to expand the reach and impact of digital preservation discussions, ultimately leading to a more interconnected and robust international community.
This initiative represents a crucial step towards democratizing knowledge access in digital preservation, aligning with iPRES’s mission to foster global collaboration and knowledge exchange in the field.",,"Arnaud Hulstaert, Hugues Cazeaux, Marion Ville, Mikael MECHOULAM, Morgän Attias","Etienne Valade, Morgän Attias","Arnaud Hulstaert, Hugues Cazeaux, Marion Ville, Mikael MECHOULAM",,,,2024-09-16,12:00,4 hours,,loveling,,,,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)

The purpose of the study is to identify and rank the common stressors facing digital preservationists; identify correlations between stressors, working conditions, and other demographics; and explore whether there is evidence to support the theory that the inherent challenges of digital preservation (e.g. volume of work, fragility/ephemerality of the materials, rapid technological obsolescence, lack of available resources, etc.) are contributing to burnout and/or anxiety/depression among digital preservationists.

A survey was distributed to the Canadian digital preservationist community asking respondents questions about the stressors related to the components of their digital preservation programs; stress related to their use of technology; the impacts of their roles as digital preservationists on their stress and anxiety levels; their satisfaction with their jobs; their susceptibility to burnout; and their perceptions of their levels of generalized stress and anxiety. Respondents were also asked to identify their mood as well as any symptoms related to anxiety/depression that may have recently resulted from the stress of their work. Additional questions pertaining to age, gender, employment, and working conditions were also posed to respondents.

The survey data was then analyzed by University of Winnipeg Master’s of Development Practice (Indigenous Development) students in their Quantitative Research Methods class.  Students were asked to respond to selected research questions and create data visualizations illustrating their findings.

The National Archives (UK) have been working on some significant improvements to DROID in the last year.  These have focused on addressing some of the main problems that users (particularly those who are new to using DROID) encounter with the application.  Most importantly though, has been the addition of a new feature to allow DROID to generate customisable, templated metadata manifests which can be used as an early step in cataloguing digital files or preparing them for processing.

But not all organisations are comfortable with fully outsourcing the responsibility for holding digital records, and may also worry about topics such as exit planning when moving to a new supplier or business continuity and disaster recovery in case of short or long-term issues with the cloud platform or provider.  Generally, some archives will be more comfortable if they also hold their own copy of their digital records in a form that can be read without need for proprietary systems or products. 

The National Archives (UK) are making use of a cloud-based managed service for the actively managed and immediately accessible copy of their records but have also built a Custodial Copy system which automatically and immediately takes a copy of all records as they appear in the cloud-based system, and sends a copy to decoupled off-cloud storage.

- Are my collections intact and replicated at the intended sites?
- Is the preservation network working properly? (Are all nodes operational and communicating correctly with each other?)
- Have any copies ever needed repair ?
Moreover, archivists also need to keep a complete history of their preservation network, ensuring that every action can be traced and used for auditing purposes.
In this lightning talk, I will explain how we implemented our dashboard solution to ensure enduring observability in a distributed preservation network, highlighting its key features.
While the solution is applicable to any digital preservation network, I will illustrate it on the specific use case of SAFE PLN, a LOCKSS-based preservation network operated by seven university libraries, which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year. 
In SAFE PLN, content is automatically collected from the institutional repositories of the 7 participating universities and distributed to preservation nodes across Europe and Canada.
Copies are then regularly verified and automatically repaired using the LOCKSS technology developed at Stanford University. This open-source software was specifically designed to secure many distributed copies of digital archives and guarantee their integrity over the very long term. 
By design, the peer-to-peer architecture of a LOCKSS network makes it truly decentralized and highly resistant to internal and external attacks. 
But for the same reason, it's also difficult to monitor the status of the preservation network.
Our open source dashboard solution based on Grafana provides each network member with global and detailed views of the network status, enabling each participant to track the status of their archived copies in real time. Problems in the network are also detected and reported instantly, enabling us to react quickly.
By ensuring observability and transparency, our dashboard contributes to making preservation networks more efficient, and brings greater peace of mind to all those concerned with protecting digital assets. 
Our solution has already been adopted by the Alabama Digital Preservation Network and is currently being deployed at the Michigan Digital Preservation Network.","Digital archivists must monitor their preservation networks by confirming the integrity and replication of collections, the operational status of all nodes, and whether any copies required repair, while maintaining a traceable history for audits.

In 2020, the authors joined the EDC and made explicit the implicit policy in place. They created formal collection management, collection cataloguing and preservation policies.  As part of the process, they undertook a Digital Preservation Coalition’s Rapid Assessment Model (RAM) review and created a development plan.  These activities were focused on the preservation aspects of the service and applied mainly to internal processes. 
In January 2024, the EDC was accepted onto the FAIR-IMPACT repository support programme which aims to help repositories support the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable principles.  As part of the EDC’s FAIR-IMPACT action plan policies and practices are being reviewed with a FAIR perspective. 
This poster will discuss these two approaches, their synergies and differences in supporting the creation of polices & procedures with FAIR principles or preservation in mind and how these two approaches have led to a better service. Current observations are below. 
(1) There is a different level of granularity and scale between preservation and FAIR: the FAIR principles start at the dataset level; most preservation repositories will deal with collections of objects. 
(2) Both approaches stress the importance of understanding the licenses connected to the content and that the descriptive metadata ensures that objects can be retrieved and understood, there is more emphasis in the FAIR resources on common domain ontologies/vocabularies whereas preservation resources discuss the importance of the knowledge level of the designated community.  
(3) Trust in the repository and resource are important, FAIR principles have more emphasis on machine retrieval and hence how can the repository demonstrate trust through its API. 
For the EDC, being able to preserve the collection for the long-term so that it is usable in the future and ensuring that the datasets within the collection are FAIR are equal priorities and using these approaches to focus on different aspects has improved the service.","The Energy Data Centre (EDC), a part of the UK Energy Research Centre, focuses on sustainable energy research and manages UK energy data.

We will highlight those access related tasks which tend to be the most resource intensive and which can be considered bottlenecks in the process of scaling up, and we will share lessons learned, both good and bad.
We represent NEA (Netværket Elektronisk Arkivering – Network for Electronic Archiving), which is a network consisting of 31 Danish municipal archives, in which resources are pooled to build an organization capable of handling the challenges of digital archiving. Throughout the past 15 years or so, NEA has assisted our member archives in preserving more than 2000 databases, of which more than 1000 have been made available for use, using our in-house developed tool, called MiNEA.
Danish municipal archives are tasked with preserving municipal public records, which in Denmark for the past 15-20 years have been almost exclusively digital. The main reason for preserving all these records is to preserve historical documentation about the Danish public administration for future generations, but also to serve the public as well as the municipal administrations that created the records in the first place. As even the oldest born-digital records are still very young, historical interest is low, and so the vast majority of inquires come from the public and from the municipal authorities who originally created the data. These inquiries usually match the types of inquiries made of the original IT systems, in which the records were created. For instance, finding all case records related to a specific personal ID number, all records related to a specific plot of land, etc.
We expect to showcase our tool alongside the poster, showing of the main features and allowing visitors to try it out for themselves.","This poster aims to spark a conversation about the challenges of providing large-scale access to archived databases, drawing from our experiences over the past decade.

The goal is to implement a trustworthy and FAIR-enabling long-term preservation solution endorsed by research communities at partner institutions, implementing best practices certified by the CoreTrustSeal. Based on the confidentiality and sensitivity of the data suitable measures are taken to ensure information security. By doing so, valuable research data will not only be properly archived, but it will also unlock the potential for data sharing and effectively lead to a more efficient use of resources. It aims to fill the void for domains and/or use cases where existing solutions do not satisfy all needs in terms of e.g. security and the FAIR principles. 

Throughout the development of the FAIRVault we want to keep the expectations of divers stakeholders and entities in mind: (1) researchers, who bear the responsibility of ensuring the findability and accessibility of data over the medium to long term, even beyond the project funding periods, (2) institutions, both research and government, that aim to manage data assets in compliance with regulations, policies and contractual obligation, fostering openness and minimizing costs, (3)  data re-users, who seek transparent access processes, (4) the Flemish Government, that envisions stronger connections to the European Open Science Cloud, (5) FOSB/FRDN members, who seek cost effective solutions for Open Science KPI targets, (6) research funders, who prioritize  ethical and legal data management aligned with the FAIR principles, (7) the European Open Science Cloud, that aims to streamline research data infrastructure through interoperability principles and standards, and (8) other research institutions, given the aim to provide an operational service beyond the initial consortium.","The FAIRVault project is a collaboration among four Flemish universities to create a secure, FAIR-aligned solution for archiving and accessing research data, especially in cases where external repositories are unsuitable.

We examined how webpage lifespans have evolved using a sample of 27.3 million URLs archived from 1996 to 2021 by the Internet Archive (IA).

We found that only 35% of URLs remained active in 2023, indicating significant web inactivity over time. Our preliminary analysis suggests that these numbers are not inflated with soft 404s and other phenomena. We encountered DNS failures for 30% of 7 million unique domains. Surprisingly, almost half of the URLs initially archived in 1996–2000 were still active in 2023, suggesting the longevity of some early URLs. Sites like nasa.gov continue to exist. Conversely, some URLs had lifespans that defied measurement. Nearly 30% had short lifespans, with only one archived page or no ""200 OK"" mementos, indicating brief existence or limited archival interest.

The average lifespan of a web page in our dataset is 1.6 years. However, this average conceals the bimodal nature of root URLs, where 10% persist for less than a year, and nearly 20% thrive for over 20 years, resulting in an average lifespan of 3.9 years. Deep links have an average lifespan of 1.3 years.

We examined web page half-life, the time it takes for half of the pages to disappear. Root URLs had a half-life of nine years compared to one year for deep links. URLs from different decades exhibited varying lifespans: 1990s URLs had a half-life of 15-20 years, early 2000s URLs had 6-7 years, and URLs from 2003 to 2021 had 6 months to 3 years.

Using the IA as a source for sample URLs provides the only realistic, public option to study the evolution of the web at this scale and duration. However, there are well-known classes of pages that are not present in the Wayback Machine and our findings apply only to publicly archivable pages. They provide a nuanced understanding of web page longevity, emphasizing that while some URLs survive a long time, most have an ephemeral lifespan.","The lifespan of a web page, previously estimated at ""44 to 100 days,"" has significantly changed since 1996.

The average web page lifespan is 1.6 years, but this masks a bimodal distribution, where 10% last under a year and nearly 20% thrive for over 20 years.

There are many platforms with different functions and characteristics, and they have different impacts on the production and preservation ecosystem of an artwork. Examples include social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter/X which are both a subject and medium of art, platforms such as Steam, the App Store or Github which are at the core of software distribution, and Discord, Slack or Stack Overflow where discussions about games and software-based art happen. Even though these platforms are very different, they raise some common concerns for preservation, namely around the dependency on an online resource where users have little to no control on the resource's evolution and longevity.
This is true in both the video game and the software-based art preservation contexts. Using the examples of the game TerraTech by Payload Studios, available on Steam, and the artwork Go Rando, by artist Ben Grosser,available on Chrome store, this presentation uses these two platforms to illustrate how platformisation, and the changes it drives in the ecosystems of artworks and videogames affects preservation, both positively and negatively. It also asks how practice is changing, or how it should be changing, to address these new ecosystems.","Platformisation, which centralizes production, distribution, and communication through online platforms, significantly influences the creation and preservation of cultural artifacts in the 21st century.

The project focuses on three key data governance tasks: dataset discovery, interoperable tooling, and automated form generation. Flanders, a front-runner in adopting SHACL, provides a unique testing ground for these innovations.

The European Data Governance Act (DGA) seeks to promote fair and equitable data usage, enhance trust in data sharing, and establish a framework for data governance within the EU. Flanders, with its OSLO programme defining over 134 ratified semantic standards, is well-positioned to address data governance challenges through Linked Data technologies.

##Project Goals:
1. Data Discovery: Develop an algorithm for efficient dataset discovery using SHACL shapes, reducing discovery time from days to seconds. This will be piloted in at least two data portals, targeting a discovery rate of 20 datasets per second.
2. Interoperable Tooling: Create an automation strategy for connecting different data processors across project partners Sirus, Inuits, and Redpencil. This involves developing a shared specification for interoperable workflows, allowing seamless data integration and processing.
3. Automated Form Generation: Generate web forms for data collection automatically using SHACL shapes. This aims to cover 80% of existing data types, significantly reducing the manual effort required for form creation.

The project will culminate in a proof-of-concept map displaying traffic measurements across Flanders, showcasing the automated selection and integration of datasets based on SHACL shapes.

Archives, tasked with preserving the files of public authorities, are therefore confronted with the need to preserve also the emails linked to the public tasks of these authorities. The technical challenges surrounding email archiving have been long and extensively deliberated. Since 2013, Capstone archiving has emerged as a means to efficiently retain the vast amounts of emails sent and received by 'key figures' of public institutions and address deficiencies in manual archiving practices. While this approach holds significant promise and is thus being adopted or seriously considered by several archives, among which the Belgian State Archives, the legal intricacies associated with this approach remain inadequately elucidated. Specifically, a deeper examination of the legal ramifications stemming from the adoption of this US-origin methodology within the European context seems necessary.

In our poster, we will assess if and how Capstone can be a viable solution for European archives, compliant with legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We look at several possible cases, such as individual versus team mailboxes, and different aspects of digital preservation, including consultation of the emails in the short and long run. As with most data protection questions, the answers are not limited to yes or no but depend on the details of each situation.","Emails are now a crucial part of public administration's work tools, prompting archives to preserve these communications linked to official duties.

The University first embarked on web archiving through collecting community responses to the Covid-19 pandemic. This initiative provided a valuable opportunity to explore closer working with the UK Web Archive (UKWA) and to demonstrate the value of web archiving to the digital preservation of the institutional record. Further collaboration with the UKWA as part of an externally-funded project, Archive of Tomorrow, supported recruitment of a dedicated Web Archivist. This increased visibility and capacity allowed the University Archives to collaborate more meaningfully with the Website and Communications team who support web services for the institution’s many diverse communities. This poster will describe this collaboration and the shared roles and responsibilities for ensuring a sustainable and effective web service for users, from creation to long-term preservation. 

The institutional web estate (both at the main URL and thousands of off-domain URLs) encompasses a vast array of valuable resources – from press releases to research project websites. In the absence of established pathways to the Archives for digital records, web archiving provides a strategy to capture some record of almost every activity and function of the institution, all in the context of their presence on the Web. This Web Lifecycle programme partners closely the UKWA, using their infrastructure and guidance as a core strategy to support the preservation of most content in scope. This partnership allows the Archive to focus on quality assurance, troubleshooting, and metadata creation, improving the existing records in the UKWA and also supporting institutional requirements without maintaining a local system or contracting a third-party vendor.  

This poster will discuss the benefits of this collaborative approach to web archiving to meet institutional digital preservation requirements. It will also address some of the limitations and challenges, such as licencing and aligning information policies across a complex, devolved web estate.

indico237,Open Science Against Humanity and Open <3 Science Card Games,2024-05-14 14:27:28.784107+00:00,Game,Interactive formats,Communications and Advocacy for DP,From document to data,"Engagement with Open Science and digital preservation can present a challenge because of their (perceived) abstract and theoretical nature. The GHOST (Games of Horror in Open Science Training) Collective uses gamification to lower this barrier and spark interest in these topics with researchers and other practitioners. Because many Open Science concepts are concerned with digital preservation, the following GHOST games are very applicable and inspirational to the iPRES audience. 

[Open Science Against Humanity][1] is based on the Cards Against Humanity gameplay concept. Players hold several cards in their hands that can be matched to the prompts on the table. The funniest or most on-fleek response to each prompt ‘wins’; the winning player gets to keep the prompt. Whoever has won the most rounds at the end, wins the game. The prompts and responses are all related to several Open Science aspects, including the preservation of data and software and the significant effort associated with it - something that all digital preservationalists will recognise. Players are encouraged to make humorous moves but also look up and discuss the meaning of cards or terms they do not know and thus learn about various aspects of Open Science

[Open <3 Science][2] is more content-focused. Players still hold several cards in their hands and get prompts on the table, but they are encouraged to find the best match based on factual and/or practical content. The prompts are about Open Science principles, while the response cards contain Open Science concepts, including a brief explanation and a QR code that leads to bibliographic source material where players can find more in-depth explanations about the concept. Players are encouraged to discuss which response is the best match to the prompt, based on what they learned about the concepts at hand. Also here, there are many concepts that digital preservationalists will know, from licences and digital sovereignty to labour-intensiveness and community.

In the session, players are invited to try both games in several groups. Each game takes approximately 20 minutes to play, depending on the discussions. Players can walk in and out freely.

We will share the practical processes that we used to identify and gather information on the born-digital assets in ASC’s collections and some of the questions that we asked ourselves to establish what we needed to record in the register.  This includes how we went about finding digital material in our processed and unprocessed collections, recording and checking locations for the material, as well as logging and checking physical storage media to record its condition.

We intend to detail the work that went into developing the asset register itself using Microsoft Lists and other Office 365 tools and sharing the decision making around settling on these tools and how they fit in with our institution’s information technology support.

The digital asset register has been integrated with our digital archiving logs, another tool developed in-house, allowing us to log digital preservation actions against each asset in the register.  This will be touched upon as well as sharing our methods for the ongoing work to identify and add digitised material to the register.

indico242,Enabling easier discovery with a controlled vocabulary for iPRES papers,2024-05-14 15:12:38.269794+00:00,Poster,Posters Meetup at Kiosk,Managing Access,Start 2 preserve,"Many iPRES papers often receive relatively few citations, indicating low levels of re-use. Whilst these low levels of usage cannot be attributed to a single reason, inconsistent approaches to sharing, publishing, and describing papers over the past twenty years have not helped. This poster goes some way to explore a solution for more consistent description of papers, facilitating their findability and thus their potential for re-usability, by proposing a controlled vocabulary for iPRES submissions. 

A controlled vocabulary for iPRES papers was used in the early days of iPRES, namely the ACM set of classification codes. This however had limited specificity relevant to most iPRES submissions and was later abandoned. The current 'anything goes' approach enables greater specificity but results in more variation across the corpus as a whole: the problem has escalated from insufficient choice to too much choice. Search the iPRES keywords index produced for the DPC Registries of Good Practice, for example, and it suggests over a thousand different entries. The phrase 'needle in a haystack' comes to mind, especially problematic for not only early careerists and researchers but also practitioners with limited amounts of time but urgent business problems to address.

This poster proposes a controlled set of keywords as a first step towards improving consistent classification, findability and subsequently re-usability of our field's knowledge. The core structure is provided by the high level entities from the CHARM domain model on digital preservation risk. These identify at a consistently granular level the main aspects of the digital preservation domain (e.g. legal; policy; strategy; system software; network; metadata; content) and target values (e.g. authenticity; integrity; retrievability). These are supplemented by a cross referencing and subsequent merging of the top 30 (or so) keywords identified by the Good Practice project, and finally a gap analysis by the authors to identify and propose additional terms for areas that are possibly under-represented. Pending discussion with the community during iPRES and subsequent refinement of terms, the results (along with a user guide to facilitate consistent implementation) will be suggested to the iPRES steering group as a proposal for future events.","Many iPRES papers have low citation rates, suggesting minimal re-use due to inconsistent sharing and publishing practices over the last two decades. This poster proposes a controlled vocabulary for iPRES submissions to enhance the description and findability of papers, addressing the issue of excessive keyword variation.

Digital Preservation with a French Touch,2024-05-14 15:21:38.634633+00:00,Birds of a Feather,Interactive formats,Communications and Advocacy for DP,From document to data,"The digital preservation field predominantly relies on English-language resources and documentation, presenting significant challenges for the Francophone community. Factors like staff training and the utilization of accented characters in alphabets exacerbate these difficulties, warranting targeted solutions to enhance Francophone contributions to the global digital preservation discourse.

In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, English has emerged as the lingua franca, shaping the discourse and dissemination of knowledge. Consequently, most technical discussions, guides, and scholarly articles pertinent to digital preservation are predominantly available in English. This linguistic hegemony poses barriers for Francophones seeking active engagement in digital preservation efforts. Language barriers not only impede comprehension and participation but also limit access to cutting-edge knowledge and practices within the field.

Addressing these challenges is imperative to ensure equitable representation and active involvement of the Francophone community in digital preservation endeavors. Efforts must be directed towards enhancing staff training by providing resources and professional development programs in the native language of Francophones. Additionally, unique challenges associated with utilizing alphabets containing accented characters must be acknowledged and resolved to facilitate effective data management and preservation in Francophone contexts.

The ""birds of a feather"" session presents a singular opportunity to convene the Francophone digital preservation community for face-to-face discussions. This gathering will enable participants to share experiences, address challenges, and exchange best practices in an environment conducive to collaboration and idea-sharing. By bringing together Francophone experts and practitioners in digital preservation, this session aims to strengthen community bonds and identify innovative solutions to overcome linguistic and technical barriers.

Born-digital archives, however, provide strong arguments for both parties to engage actively and even require creators to be more involved. The case for partnerships between archivists, researchers and literary authors in dealing with born-digital archives has been made many times, but only continues to grow in importance as more born-digital archives are making their way into literary archival institutions (Pulkkinen 2023; Jaillant 2022; Ries & Palkó 2019; Gooding, Smith & Mann, 2019). 
The scale and complexity of born-digital archives enforces strong partnerships between creators, archives and research in order to guarantee a real future for born-digital (literary) heritage. Genuine collaboration between scholars and archivists creates many pathways for developing and enhancing archival workflows for acquiring, describing and unlocking born-digital archives for research. Researchers get better acquainted with limitations and possibilities of born-digital archives, enabling them to articulate solid research questions. Collaboration with creators is no less important, as they play a crucial role in the preservation of their digital documents (Micunovic, Marčetić, and Krtalić 2016).
In this Lightning Talk we share our experience of the collaboration between the Letterenhuis (Isabelle Van Ongeval) and the University of Antwerp (Lamyk Bekius) in the scope of born-digital archives. Our regular meetings to discuss approaches and research interests regarding born-digital archives have already led to concrete results. These include: joining forces in persuading Flemish authors to donate their old computers to the Letterenhuis and make them available for research projects; working together on a project with the Flemish poet Maud Vanhauwaert to log the writing process of a poem for the Letterenhuis’ new collection exhibition; an exploration of the filecontents on the floppy disks of the Flemish poet and essayist Herman de Coninck to make them more findable and more accessible for research; and partnering up for the (proposed) CLARIAH-VL+ International Research Infrastructure, in which we plan to develop a model for the description of born-digital and hybrid (literary) archives.","The shift to born-digital archives necessitates active collaboration between archivists, researchers, and creators to effectively manage and preserve literary heritage. Partnerships enhance archival workflows and help researchers navigate the complexities of these digital records, resulting in more targeted research questions.

This implies safeguarding our own digital collections, of which we are the sole custodian, as these often include unique materials created by our scientific community. Examples include Ph.D. theses, offprints, and research data.
We must also ensure enduring access to subscribed scholarly content even if the subscription is canceled or if publishers discontinue publications. 
To meet these challenges, we encourage libraries to adopt a global strategy based on three solutions leveraging the LOCKSS open-source technology. 
Our poster depicts the implementation of this 3-pillar strategy at Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB) :

**1. Community network**
While a university library alone is unlikely to have the required human and technological resources to build an efficient distributed preservation solution, LOCKSS technology makes it easy for libraries to build their own community network to safeguard their collections of interest. 
Following this approach, ULB - together with 6 university partners worldwide - has funded the SAFEPLN network in 2014. 
Content is collected from our institutional repositories and replicated in seven preservation nodes, distributed across servers hosted in Europe and Canada.
Currently, a dozen similar networks have been created worldwide, with various objectives, scopes and organizational models.

**2. Global LOCKSS Network**
As a solution for post-cancellation access to our electronic resources, ULB joined the Global LOCKSS Network in 2012.
If we terminate a subscription to one of our resources or the resource becomes temporarily unavailable from the publisher, a copy remains available in our local server and we can restore access to our users.

**3. CLOCKSS**
Unfortunately, not all our key electronic resources are available on the Global LOCKSS network. Therefore, ULB also chose to support the CLOCKSS service from 2024. 
CLOCKSS is a dark archive encompassing over 54 million journal articles, and 475.000 e-books from the world's leading publishers, ensuring open access if content disappears from the web.

The three-pillar approach outlined here empowers libraries to take charge of their digital preservation. Instead of relying on third-party solutions, we become active players in preservation, embracing our essential mission.","As university libraries, we aim to safeguard scholarly digital content for future generations, ensuring the preservation of unique materials created by our academic community.

Keeping track of documentation and to-dos is challenging in the early stages of program development. 

Workflows, traditionally seen as documentation tools, offer a unique solution for tracking the development of digital preservation programs. Instead of viewing workflows as static documents, they can be transformed into dynamic roadmaps that guide practitioners through the program’s inception and evolution.  By crafting bespoke, high-level workflows tailored to individual institutional contexts, practitioners can effectively use them as planning tools. These workflows serve not only as project management tools to track progress but also help effectively communicate with program stakeholders. 

Workflows were used in planning Acadia University’s digital preservation program. The development of an ingest workflow identified key components of digital preservation, including ensuring authenticity, fixity, processing, and transfer into long-term storage. Identifying these components ensured tools were procured that adequately addressed ingest requirements. Sharing practical lessons learned through utilizing workflows in the planning stages of creating a new digital preservation program allows for other institutions to follow a similar process. Workflows, policy, and implementation are interrelated, and focusing on workflows highlighted priorities for Acadia’s policy development. Workflow planning allows small institutions to implement realistic digital preservation programs.","Developing a digital preservation program from the ground up entails various elements, including defining the program's scope and executing preservation strategies.

Metadata plays a key role across all of our processes, from preservation to enabling dissemination through search. Hence, improving the accessibility and management of metadata are crucial activities of our operations, in particular with the ever-growing scale in volume and heterogeneity. To this end, meemoo is currently evolving towards a Knowledge Graph-based infrastructure. In this poster, we present our new set of data models that support this endeavor.

The meemoo data models have a layered design, with a core model that is applicable across media objects from various types accompanied by a number of domain-specific models that cover different use cases. They were developed using an iterative methodology to design, implement, and evaluate data models with internal and external stakeholders. The core Objects model builds upon PREMIS (OWL) and is used to  model the main structure of the media objects, which identifies the preserved intellectual entity, its representations, its files, and the way they relate. The domain models complement the core model and include, among others, models to describe the media contents (Descriptive model), information about the partners that own the material (Organizations model), and digitization or provenance metadata (Events model). 

The different data models are implemented using a combination of RDFS and SHACL to ensure a smooth integration in the Knowledge Graph infrastructure. The use of RDF-based standards adds greater flexibility and enhances the models’ semantic clarity. Each resource and relationship can be explicitly modeled, identified, defined and labeled, while promoting reuse through Linked Open Data. In addition, it also provides machine-readability to support automation, which enables us to automatically generate documentation or a GraphQL schema from the SHACL source files. 

Our poster illustrates the data models, the design methodology and how the data models are used across meemoo in various applications and with different purposes. Both documentation and sources are available on [our developer documentation website][1].

In 2024 the digital preservation community can look back with pride on what we have achieved. However, new challenges appear on the horizon, often originating from areas beyond our profession. We may no longer be able to conquer these within the existing preservation community, like we are used to do. But perhaps we can find inspiration for new initiatives by looking back at how it all started.
Three decades ago, in 1998, a group of 60 people gathered in Hotel dos Templarios in Tomar, Portugal. They arrived from around 20 countries to participate in the first international workshop on digital preservation in Europe. The air was filled with eagerness and enthusiasm. Everyone felt part of a new and adventurous journey: how to preserve electronic (aka digital) heritage.
This DELOS 6th workshop on Preservation was organized by two (!) projects funded by the European Commission: DELOS, consisting of computer scientists and NEDLIB, a project of national libraries. Two different worlds coming together in one place.
The 15 presenters at the workshop spoke on a range of topics, seemingly inspired by the 1996 report of Garrett and Waters “Preserving digital information”. On this poster I’ll map these topics to the status quo to show the tremendous progress the digital preservation community has made. Over time, the heritage organisations involved were able to translate the problems into workable solutions. Individual initiatives were connected in collaborative projects, initiated and funded by heritage organisations themselves with the support of the European Commission, the National Science Foundation and various governments. The profession of digital preservation shaped itself.
The Tomar workshop started with a film “Into the Future. On the preservation of knowledge”. An initiative of CLIR, still available on Vimeo. The film aimed to raise awareness, amongst the general public and policy makers, of the risk of losing digital information. In just 50 minutes, broadcast via television, it conveyed the necessity of digital preservation.  
How might we grab the attention of today's decision makers in a similarly creative way?","In 2024, the digital preservation community will celebrate its achievements, yet new challenges loom, often from outside the field. Overcoming these obstacles may require fresh perspectives, inspired by our origins. In 1998, 60 participants from around 20 countries attended the first European workshop on digital preservation in Tomar, Portugal, filled with enthusiasm for preserving digital heritage. This event, organized by two EU-funded projects, united computer scientists and national libraries.

indico258,Using the CoSAI ecosystem to archive scholarly code with docs and discussions,2024-05-14 20:04:49.249456+00:00,Tool Demo,Interactive formats,Approaches to Preservation,From document to data,"As more scholars code in the open, digital stewards need accessible methods to reliably archive this code and surrounding contextual information. We will be demo-ing a software and Web archive workflow using an interconnected ecosystem of open source tools: [OCCAM][1] with plugins for [Memento Tracer][2] and [Memento Damage][3]. We use these together to create a repeatable, human- and computer-readable workflow to preserve scholarly code on the Web with its discussion threads, documentation, and other contextual scholarly ephemera that you can’t get with a `git clone`. 

OCCAM is an open source software preservation and workflow execution system that allows users to visually create executable workflows. OCCAM instances can federate with each other, allowing for these to be shared. Memento Tracer is a browser extension that allows users to click on desired elements from  an exemplar webpage to create JSON ‘traces,’ which are then used to crawl and create Web archives. These traces can be used on websites that look similar to each other (e.g. code repositories on GitHub or GitLab) and can themselves be version controlled. Memento Damage is an open source tool that calculates how well a web page is archived by identifying the missing resources (images, multimedia, CSS, and JavaScript) and then measuring the importance of those missing resources.

We use OCCAM as the “driver,” where we visually build (via drag-and-drop) the processes together and run it together. So we use Git clone to grab the source code, as well as run a Memento trace to grab other elements of a repository page that we want to keep for history and debugging purposes -- issue threads, pull requests, project boards, online documentation, etc. We end up with a local copy of a Git repository (to preserve the commit history) and a WARC containing the Web-based contextual information. We then use Memento Damage to do some initial quality assurance and checking. We can then export this together with some metadata and it’s ready for a repository! [See an example of this workflow][4] in OCCAM.

However, digital preservation professionals face significant challenges in archiving this content. This ""Birds of a Feather"" session aims to bring together digital archivists, researchers, and allied professionals to discuss these barriers and explore collaborative strategies for advocating change.

Current legal restrictions, such as platform terms of service that prohibit web scraping and API limitations, hinder the ability to capture and preserve social media content for research and cultural heritage purposes. These restrictions even extend to archiving government information shared through official social media accounts. In this session, we will facilitate discussions on specific barriers including but not limited to the legal, ethical, policy-related, practical, technological and organisational contexts of social media archiving in research and cultural heritage institutions. We will also share experiences navigating these challenges, as well as brainstorm advocacy strategies to tackle these barriers and change the existing framework. 

We aim to engage a diverse group of representative stakeholders and experts, including archivists and digital preservation professionals from academic institutions, government bodies, and (private) cultural heritage organisations, as well as researchers, legal experts, and technologists. Even though the framework for social media archiving is embedded in the local context (due to national laws, institutional preferences etc.), participants from all over the world are welcome to participate to share experiences and solutions and/or bring creativity to the table to brainstorm together in a highly interactive session. 

We hope to foster a sense of community and shared purpose among participants. Ideal outcomes include plans for drafting position papers or best practices, a short report on the current state of the art of social media archiving for archival and research purposes and increased motivation to advocate for change within participants' respective institutions and professional networks.",,"Ellen Van Keer, Friedel Geeraert, Katrien Weyns, Zefi Kávvadia",Zefi Kávvadia,"Ellen Van Keer, Friedel Geeraert, Katrien Weyns",,,,2024-09-19,09:00,45 minutes,,artiestenfoyer,,,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tRNyfbNP9rd6Nq9TOZMF7_9QE7lrJDB_7P1twUV3R78/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)

The goal of the game is to educate those not familiar with the challenges of digital preservation about the basic aspects that inform the work of preserving and providing access to born-digital records. Each player will be attempting to determine three important facts about the digital record they are looking for: its physical media type, its file format, and applicable access approach. Using the familiar mechanism of deduction used in the popular Clue/Cluedo game, players will learn about each of these aspects.

The Belgian Science Policy Office (Belspo) has since 2015 long term digital preservation service for digital artifacts from the federal state. The technical architecture is based on a hyper secured ring network topology integrating all users and data centres. The two data centres are completely redundant and are equipped with an identical hardware infrastructure where cold storage is used as the main preservation methodology. Ingest, load balancing, authentication of users, integrity checks, file formats check, REST Api services, monitoring and retrieve workflows have been integrated in one middleware system. Belspo issued a tender procedure for the operationalisation of the hardware, software and service desk which was granted to a private partner.
The contract ended in 2022 and Belspo decided not to prolong the contract but to develop a renewed hard- and software architecture in-house with the Belgian association Smals, within the same yearly budget. Belspo launched a co-creation activity with Smals to setup a migration path and planning for the 4 Petabyte of unique volume of digital cultural heritage, research data and metadata, duplicated in both data centres. The first experiments with Arcsys showed that a simple installation, programming, and configuration did not permit to read the objects on the LTO7 tapes. A new methodology had been put in place to transfer the data in a secured way, within budget.
We stopped all new ingest in 2023, isolated the written LTO7 tapes, reconfigured one data centre and cold storage with Arcsys and began the one-by-one content migration via the Arcsys architecture with integrity and format check from one data centre to the other over secured network connectivity. Once finished the inverse operation started for guaranteeing a smooth duplication, while keeping offline the old tapes in case of lost or disaster which turned out to be an interesting decision. Two years later the operation is still going on, but with a 100% confidence not to have lost any bit.","This abstract discusses the secure migration of 4 Pb of long-term preservation data from a cold storage platform by the Belgian Science Policy Office (Belspo).

Digital preservation was everyone's—and no one's—responsibility and was mostly viewed as an IT challenge.

In 2022, a new organizational structure was introduced. It established autonomous interdisciplinary product teams consisting of both IT resources and expert resources from the various media departments.

As part of this reorganization, digital preservation was established as a *product* at the National Library with its own team. The digital preservation team now develops digital preservation as a product and offers it as a service to other interdisciplinary teams in the organization.

With this lightning talk, I hope to expand awareness and usage of this corpus for a key purpose: a better shared understanding of the history of our field and its practice. While this emulation bibliography provides vital resources for students and new professionals to build their skills and catch up on a robust area of technological research and development (and within itself containing micro-trends on potential sub-topics: emulation tooling, linked open data for emulation, emulation for archival access, emulation for curation, etc.), it also presents an opportunity for reflection for more seasoned practitioners: how far have we actually come over 30 years? What patterns have emerged in our writing, theory, and use cases for emulation? Are there gaps between the written record and actual lived experience of the field and its implemented practice? These are bigger questions than I can answer in the course of 5 minutes, but by simultaneously posing them and pointing to the means to engage further, I hope this lightning talk would also lay the groundwork for a more in-depth literature review or paper on the history of emulation practice in digital preservation at a future conference.","What began as a simple request for emulation readings for a guest lecture evolved into a comprehensive Zotero bibliography on emulation for digital preservation, now featuring around 200 references spanning 30 years.

Together, LAAWS and DART foster greater local control over the network infrastructure and make depositing content easier for users with little-to-no technical skill. By contributing to this centralized statewide preservation service, member institutions avoid redundant efforts, share resources, and make preservation more affordable for all.

This lightning talk centers on learnings from Phase One of our grant, which focused on identifying five geographically distributed LOCKSS server hosts, testing the new LAAWS documentation and installing the software, configuring DART, creating a deposit pathway between DART and LOCKSS, running deposit tests with partners, and documenting any challenges. Key takeaways include balancing aspirational vision with “on-the-ground” needs and costs, the importance of approaching “non-traditional” partners, managing relationships with collaborators, the value and challenges of local control, and how a network centered on cooperation, trust, and support can create easier “on ramps” to preservation and empower institutions to take more ownership of digital preservation. 

The MDPN is - by all accounts from the LOCKSS Program - the first preservation network to use the LAAWS software across our entire production network infrastructure, and other institutions may find our experience useful. Although this case study focuses on our work in Michigan, the outcomes are relevant to a broad audience and could be replicated in many different contexts.

As is often the case in libraries, competing priorities may result in limited resources for strictly managing digital collections. Beyond making digital collections accessible, abstracting born digital and digitized collections into datasets for digital scholarship could pose a myriad of technical, legal, resource, and workflow challenges.   

The Library of Congress recognizes the critical need for determining and implementing a coordinated approach to support use of collections for digital scholarship, as outlined in the [Digital Collections Strategy][1]. Prior to and as a result of the strategy, options for advancing this work were explored through a variety of experiments, pilots, research reports, and working group discussions. 

This year, the Library of Congress reached a major milestone in hiring its first Digital Collections Data Librarian to routinize the service of creating collections as data for researcher access.   

The Digital Collections Data Librarian works within the Library ’s Digital Collections Management and Services Division to centralize work and support computational use of the Library’s born digital and digitized collections and implement a coordinated approach to support use of collections as data for digital scholarship. 

The Data Librarian is formalizing and enhancing previously piloted efforts to transform data from digital collections, including born digital content, digitized books, and web archives, into datasets ready for computational use. They are providing analysis and advice, and developing solutions to solve issues and problems associated with digital lifecycle management of collections and derived datasets.  

For the lightning talk, we will give an overview on how the position originated, onboarding and orientation efforts, projects underway and outcomes/accomplishments achieved within the first few months. We will also outline upcoming plans and ways that attendees can get updates on this new program area.

The GDELT project leverages some Google Cloud services to transcribe and translate these archived TV news collections and makes them more accessible. However, the amount of transcribed and translated text produced daily can be overwhelming for human consumption in its raw form. In this work we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize daily news and facilitate semantic search and question answering against the longitudinal index of the TV news archive.

The end-to-end pipeline of this process includes tasks of TV stream archiving, audio extraction, transcription, translation, chunking, vectorization, clustering, sampling, summarization, and representation. Translated transcripts are split into smaller chunks of about 30 seconds (a tunable parameter) with the assumption that this duration is neither too large to accommodate multiple concepts nor too small to fit only a partial concept discussed on TV. These chunks are treated as independent documents for which vector representations (or document embeddings) are created. These vectors are clustered using algorithms like KNN or DBSCAN to identify pieces of transcripts throughout the day that are repetitions of similar concepts. The centroid of each cluster is selected as the representative sample for their topics. GPT models are leveraged to summarize each sample. We have crafted a prompt that instructs the GPT model to synthesize the most prominent headlines, their descriptions, various types of classifications, and keywords/entities from provided transcripts.

We classify clusters to identify whether they represent ads or local-news that might not be of the interest of the international audience. After excluding unnecessary clusters, the interactive summary of each headline is rendered in a web application. We also maintain metadata of each chunk (video IDs and timestamps) that we use in the representation to embed a corresponding small part of the archived video for reference.

Furthermore, valuable chunks of transcripts and associated metadata are stored in a vector database to facilitate semantic search and LLM-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

We have deployed a test instance of our experiment and open-sourced our implementation (https://github.com/internetarchive/newsum).","The Internet Archive preserves international television news across various languages, while the GDELT project utilizes Google Cloud services for transcription and translation, enhancing accessibility.

Anyone curious about emulation or preserving access to software or born-digital collections is welcome and encouraged to participate. 

The emerging EaaSI Research Alliance—an international community of libraries, archives, and museums using the Emulation-as-a-Service Infrastructure (EaaSI) software—offers a promising opportunity to bolster international cooperation and expand adoption of emulation as a method of preserving access to software and software-dependent collections. In this session, representatives from the Alliance and the Software Preservation Network will facilitate in-person and remote participants through a series of gently structured conversations designed to foster connections and make space for everyone to contribute. 

After a quick introduction to ground the session, participants will break into groups based on geography and organization type (including space for students and jobseekers).  These small group discussions will support networking within and outside of geographic and organizational definitions, leveraging common context while also imagining beyond boundaries. Because the formation of lasting collaborations is a key aim, it would be ideal to have time for two rounds of conversations: geographically-based, supporting coordination within intellectual property regimes, and institution-type-based, supporting cross-border cooperation among organizations with similar missions. 

The prompts used in the discussions will illuminate emulation-related points of alignment and difference, including salient use cases and challenges related to operational, technical, usability, climate impact, or intellectual property concerns. Each group will have a designated facilitator from the session team and a pre-identified notetaker. To support remote participation, each in-person group will also have a corresponding virtual breakout room with a pre-identified facilitator and notetaker. 

The organizers will use notes from the session to write a report for the conference proceedings and to articulate a potential set of emulation-related strategic priorities for the emerging EaaSI Research Alliance, Software Preservation Network, iPRES community, and stakeholder communities of practice. A draft of the priorities will be shared with session participants for feedback and then published in the Software Preservation Network Zenodo community to inspire future action.",,"Brenna Edwards, Claire Fox, Ethan Gates, Jessica Meyerson, Oleg Stobbe, Wendy Chu, Wendy Hagenmaier","Brenna Edwards, Claire Fox, Ethan Gates, Jessica Meyerson, Oleg Stobbe, Wendy Chu, Wendy Hagenmaier","Brandon Butler, Cynde Moya",,,,2024-09-18,15:30,45 minutes,,artiestenfoyer,,,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YyH4xDbKTY3yp65AvVROoNU9jZ3Icjgh9zaKleBYDiY/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)

At the same time, institutional moves towards digital submission procedures, e.g. university e-theses, can inadvertently encourage compression, encryption, hyperlinked content, and web-optimisation, as depositors mitigate upload constraints or rights management in the digital environment.  

 

Although we can recommend ideals around high quality deposits for preservation going forward, how do we address the challenges of our pre-existing digital collections and early legacy work? And if we choose to exclude collections based on the unavailability of appropriate preservation originals, do we risk creating inequalities that unintentionally bias our collections in the long-term, against lower-budget, often arts and humanities, and community research?  

  

This poster visualises some early findings from a project looking at e-thesis deposits as a case study for the practical decisions needed to balance inclusivity with stakeholder capacity in repository management. Data is drawn from a survey and focus groups designed to understand how and why depositors select file formats for saving and sharing projects, as well as the practical, technical and social implications of this for preservation management of born–digital assets.

They reflect the technical limitations of specific file systems and, often, the cultural context of their creators. As long as a file remains within its original environment, its name rarely raises concerns. However, when files are migrated to new systems – whether through organizational processes or preservation efforts – problems emerge.

One common approach is to normalize file names by restricting them to a limited character set. While technically expedient, this method disregards the intent of the original creator. We advocate for retaining original file names whenever possible, viewing them as critical traces of context.

However, this approach is not without challenges. We will discuss specific scenarios that have prompted us to re-examine our commitment to preserving original file names. These include file names containing control characters, Unicode Extended Use Area characters, and characters that are difficult to express in XML. Through case studies, we will explore the tension between technical pragmatism and the preservation of cultural context in digital objects.

This lightning talk aims to spark a discussion about the significance of file names in digital preservation and to encourage a more nuanced approach that balances technical considerations with respect for the cultural and historical value embedded in these seemingly mundane digital artifacts.","File names serve as more than just identifiers; they embody the digital environments of their creation.

This lightning talk, ""Whose Knowledge Counts?: Decolonisation of Knowledge for Digital Preservation and Sustainability of Indigenous Knowledge in Africa,"" addresses the critical need for inclusive digital preservation policies and practices that authentically represent Indigenous voices and perspectives.

The current findings in South Africa, reveal significant gaps in digital preservation policies for Indigenous knowledge systems (IKS) in Africa. Indigenous knowledge owners lack effective mechanisms and policies for long-term digital preservation. Although some African countries have initiated policies to manage Indigenous knowledge, there is often a lack of meaningful engagement with Indigenous communities, resulting in insufficient representation and benefits for these communities.

In Kenya, we have mapped Indigenous knowledge holders, community archives, libraries and museums in Elgeyo Marakwet County. The county leadership has embraced stakeholder involvement in digital preservation and conservation efforts, setting a precedent for community-driven initiatives in Indigenous knowledge preservation. Despite these efforts, the lack of standardized metadata for Indigenous knowledge systems hinders the accessibility and integration of local knowledge into digital preservation frameworks for more than 90 community libraries, museums, traditional medical centers, botanic gardens, cultural sites within the Keiyo and Marakwet communities of Kenya.

We have used application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, such as ChatGPT, Bing AI, and Gemini AI, which presents a promising opportunity for decolonizing knowledge and addressing metadata challenges in the global ecosystem. The AI tools can facilitate the identification, creation, discovery, access, organization, dissemination, and preservation of Indigenous knowledge. However, there is a critical need for sustained investment in local and Indigenous knowledge systems, digital inclusion and skill development to ensure that Indigenous knowledge is accurately and respectfully preserved and integrated into the global information and knowledge ecosystem. This talk showcases the ongoing partnerships between local and global stakeholders to develop inclusive and sustainable digital preservation strategies for Indigenous knowledge in Africa.","The decolonization of knowledge in Africa requires a thorough reassessment of how Indigenous knowledge is managed and preserved digitally. The talk titled ""Whose Knowledge Counts?"" emphasizes the urgent need for inclusive digital preservation strategies that genuinely reflect Indigenous insights.

We have found out in our calculations that the carbon footprint for the hardware, including both manufacturing, transportation and disposal costs, has a profound impact on the total carbon footprint of our service platform. In our platform, the hardware component carbon footprint is much greater that the service life carbon footprint (electricity consumption). Now it is time to expand our carbon footprint calculations and create a generic model for calculating the footprint in cases where hardware manufacturers do not report the in-body carbon footprint (includes hardware manufacturing, logistics and disposal) figures for their hardware.

The basic assumption is that all servers, regardless of the manufacturer, share components which have an in-body carbon footprint reported by at least one vendor. We will turn this sparse matrix for server component in-body carbon footprint values into a generic server components in-body carbon footprint calculation. This generic calculation is estimated to be fairly accurate and the goal is to develop this into an open model for hardware component carbon footprint calculation. This model would be highly beneficial to the digital preservation community in general, as it could be used by any producer of a digital preservation service to calculate their hardware component carbon footprint, without having to have separate in-depth discussions with their hardware manufacturers.

Since the previous report from 2023, the National Digital Preservation Services have expanded the platform to 7.5 Petabytes and the server manufacturer has been changed from HPE to Kaytus. At the same time the Kaytus hardware lifespan has been extended into 7 years. We have also replaced one data centre, the new data centre having a PUE of 1.05 while the previous data centre had a PUE of 1.66. This poster will use our current digital preservation platform, allowing for up to 7.5 Petabytes of data, as an example when creating a generic carbon footprint calculation using the previous assumptions detailed above.","We previously discussed carbon footprint assessments for Finland's National Digital Preservation Services in iPRES 2023. Our findings revealed that hardware-related carbon emissions, encompassing manufacturing, transport, and disposal, significantly influence the total footprint, with hardware impact outweighing that of electricity use.

The international PREMIS Editorial Committee (EC) coordinates maintenance and revisions, and provides guidance on the implementation. It is implemented in digital preservation projects around the world, and support for PREMIS is incorporated into several commercial and open-source digital preservation tools and systems. PREMIS has recently released a public draft of a major revision of its RIGHTS entity, and the Editorial Committee is continuing its practice of gathering feedback from the community and encouraging open conversations about digital preservation Rights use cases that these changes are meant to address. Please join several members of the Editorial Committee for a Birds-of-a-Feather for current PREMIS users and those who are interested in implementing PREMIS at their institution in the future. The conversation will include a brief introduction to preservation metadata and the key concepts and the data model for PREMIS. The conversation will move on to the proposed changes to the Rights entity, to gather more feedback for finalizing the update.

To be able to guarantee that ingested contents can be usable, the DPS has together with the utilizing partner organizations decided on a set of supported file formats. The files have to be valid, and both file format identification and validation are performed when ingesting the content to the DPS.

It is generally better to fix broken files as early as possible, as ingesting content to the DPS can occur at a later stage. To support partner organizations and foster digital content management expertise the DPS has published a public online file validator at: https://validation.digitalpreservation.fi/#/en

The user can upload files to the validator, which performs file format identification, technical metadata extraction and validation on the file. The validator also reports file format support in our DPS. The user can download a detailed validation report, including all collected metadata, in a JSON format.

The validator uses the same validation tools as our DPS ingest. The tool is a Python tool developed in-house called file-scraper: https://github.com/Digital-Preservation-Finland/file-scraper. File-scraper is a framework that uses several third-party and in-house tools, such as Open Preservation Foundation tools JHOVE, Fido, veraPDF and Jpylyzer, and various others, such as XmlLint, ExifTool, ImageMagick, FFmpeg, for identifying formats, collecting metadata, and validating. File-scraper detects the file-format and collects metadata based on a pre-set of tools called detectors. After, another set of tools is selected as validators based on the detected file format. Different file formats are thus validated using a different set of tools, and many formats are validated using several tools. For example, PDF/A is validated by JHOVE, veraPDF and Ghostscript, while WAVE is validated using JHOVE and FFmpeg. The metadata from all used tools, the well-formedness, and support in the DPS is harmonized into a JSON output.

The validator has been helpful in fostering digital content management and helping organizations perform digital preservation actions early on in the life cycle of the contents.

Through a sequence of meetings, engagements, a contextual overview paper, an open consultation and a final report with recommendations the group identified gaps and proposed actions. The key gap, which impacts the development of essential knowledge about roles and costs, is the uneven distribution of awareness within EOSC and beyond that active preservation requires a long term commitment to data management that must adjust to changing technologies and the changing needs of users. Progress on gap analysis issues included the recognition of the emerging need for more concrete and clearly defined sets of activities and functions for repositories, and the validation of the CoreTrustSeal proposed levels of curation and preservation care. Together these and the recommendations can support a move towards clearer typologies of repositories and their levels of speciality, responsibility, curation and preservation. 
The resources provide bite-sized contextual assertions that can be reused by actors at all levels from researchers and practitioners to funders and policy makers. There are clear calls to action that are applicable to a range of actors and that guide a cascade of progress from European, to national to institutional level.

A new “next big thing”. Some whither and die quite rapidly, but some… Some go on to have a significant impact on the digital preservation community.

We’d like to propose a BoF to enable a bit of horizon scanning to a) identify ‘the next big thing’ (or things) and how it (they) might affect the digital preservation community, and b) what we as a community should be doing about it. 

Possible contenders for the title include:
•	**Environmental impact**—There has always been a tension between resource use and preservation, especially as the ‘data deluge’ ramps up. Environmental impact adds another facet to the argument. We have a responsibility to future generations to preserve information, but we also have a responsibility to minimise our impact on the planet. Being able to measure that impact and mitigate it is becoming increasingly important.
•	**Artificial Intelligence**—It’s hard to escape the looming presence of AI. It pops up, wherever you look. Does it have a place in digital preservation?
•	**Trust**—This has many levels of complexity. We’re all familiar with the authenticity problem (how can we guarantee that information we’re preserving is the same [or provides the same experience] over the long term), but what about the trustworthiness of the information in the first place? Is it even our place as curators to question the validity of our sources?

The presentation will focus on the complexity of the workflow, the expandability, scalability, and the open issue of data monitoring.

As part of the Digital Memory project, a platform was built to enable information repositories to benefit from a centralized Preservation Service where system managers can initiate preservation pipelines and view the state of already archived records. After agreeing on a protocol, the platform can harvest data from the different repositories, transform them for long-term preservation, and store them on CERN Cloud storage (EOS). The preservation process includes different steps: validation of SIPs, normalization, and other micro-services (through Archivematica), storage on magnetic tapes, and publishing in a central registry.

The initial focal point of the project was to be able to harvest different sources of data; to achieve that, we designed an expandable architecture. Since then we have adapted to numerous repositories including InvenioRDM instances, CodiMD, GitLab, and Indico.
Another important aspect was scalability: depending on the collection the workload can be significant, therefore the platform mostly consists of async processes that can run in parallel. To help with resilience the records can be filtered based on the executed steps and status. Our Archivematica instance is deployed on OpenShift where the number of worker clients and available resources can be increased on demand.

Monitoring and appraisal are still open issues we are working on. Monitoring of already harvested records means retriggering the preservation pipeline if the data change is significant enough to justify the reprocessing. So far, the platform and registry are designed to support multiple versions of an AIP, but we intend to optimize storage by minimizing the redundancy. 
Finally, to evaluate if submitted data is part of CERN's official preservation scope, we plan to include internal expert users in the process, who would be aided by a trained model.

Digital preservation is an active process involving the ongoing use of computer systems and data storage.  This involves physical infrastructure and ICT equipment, the need for power and cooling, and a cycle of migrations and renewal.  All of which generate carbon emissions, not just from energy consumption but also as a result of the embodied footprint from the manufacture, transportation and eventual disposal of the ICT equipment involved.  But how big is this footprint?  What aspects of digital preservation contribute most such as ingest or long-term storage?  How do emissions depend on the type of content being preserved, what preservation actions are performed, and where preservation takes place such as in the cloud?  Without being able to measure and calculate carbon emissions, it is hard to work out how best to reduce these emissions, or indeed whether other organisational activities offer lower hanging fruit.   This poster explores these areas, presents a methodology for measuring carbon emissions of digital preservation, and gives some real numbers from large scale digital preservation in the cloud using real data for a range of digital preservation scenarios.   The poster includes debunking a few misconceptions about the carbon footprint of energy consumption, especially in the cloud, it directs attention to the elephant in the room that is the embodied footprint of ICT equipment (servers and storage) that form the mainstay of digital preservation systems and infrastructure, and it provides some practical suggestions on how to reduce emissions.   The overall aim of the poster is to help people understand how they can measure the carbon footprint of their digital preservation activities, how they can understand what aspects and activities contribute the most, and how they can make their own informed decisions on how to make effective reductions.","Measuring and managing carbon emissions in long-term digital preservation is crucial for environmental sustainability.

Regarding digital materials, the NDL has formulated the ""Basic Plan for Digital Preservation of National Diet Library’s Collections for 2021-2025"" and has been working on research and practice for digital preservation. The NDL is currently digitizing and migrating its collections, and as part of this process, a large-scale migration of about 10,000 optical discs was conducted in FY2023.
The migration mainly targeted CDs of book supplements published in Japan up to the year 2000. The types of discs were diverse and included CD-ROMs that simply stored a few files, audio CDs, hybrid CDs, and relatively early DVD-Video (DVD players began to be produced in 1996), as well as optical discs containing large numbers of files with programs like databases.
In order to migrate these diverse discs efficiently, we designed a workflow that classifies discs in advance and extracts data in a manner appropriate for each type of disc format. Optical discs were classified into three main categories: optical discs for simply copying files, for extracting audio tracks only, and for imaging in ISO format. It was confirmed that the method of imaging everything regardless of disc’s type was the most efficient for migration work, although there were many technical issues in searching and using the contents of image files.
In addition, in this work, all optical discs were subjected to an error check equivalent to ISO/IEC 18630:2023 before the data extraction. As a result, it was confirmed that, especially for audio CDs, there was a correlation between high error values and noise in the migration results. Therefore, we found that the appropriate use of error check can improve the efficiency of quality inspection of audio CD migration.
In this poster, we will report on the issues and propose an efficient technical method for the migration of various optical discs published more than a quarter of a century ago.","The National Diet Library (NDL) in Japan preserves collections as national cultural heritage and is focusing on digital preservation through its 2021-2025 plan.

Notably, there has been a surge in interest within the past few years regarding the interpretation of JHOVE error and warning messages, particularly when confronted with malformed or invalid information objects. 
To address this burgeoning interest and cater to the needs of the digital preservation community, the establishment of a specialised interest group focusing on the use of JHOVE is proposed. The aim of the group is to develop, provide and maintain comprehensive documentation on interpreting JHOVE messages effectively and share our experiences and the possible issues we run into.
In this BoF session, community input is sought to shape the direction of the JHOVE Special Interest Group (SIG). What specific resources or initiatives do they envision from such a group? These insights will guide the development of tailored solutions to meet the community's evolving needs.",,"Georgia Moppett, Julie Allen, Lotte Wijsman, Marin Rappard, Micky Lindlar","Georgia Moppett, Julie Allen, Lotte Wijsman, Marin Rappard, Micky Lindlar, Remco van Veenendaal",,,,,2024-09-19,11:00,45 minutes,,kabinet,,,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EutRhAckjhL6_hr09gkAhEHJ0NlYUAsC0MCQSanRpVs/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)

Of course, it all starts with preserving our digital heritage in the long term for our designated communities to find. We as a community have to help them find the information taking into account their knowledge base, needs and wishes.
But on the downside, this storage and use of digital data costs: it produces carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. It has an impact on our environment. 
A few years ago, the Dutch Digital Heritage Network started a climate awareness campaign. 
In talking to heritage organizations we realized a few things:

 - List item

Climate awareness grows and from within: a few colleagues that are ‘green minded’ meet up and campaign their cause within the organization. 

 - List item

Some heritage organizations are already taking positive climate measures: they are reusing exhibition materials, stimulating visitors to take public transport or bike to the museum, greening their buildings and depots. 

 - List item

The large impact of IT is not always noticed or taken into account. And if it is, you are faced with dilemma’s like servicing your online users in a different or slower manner or be more selective in preserving data or documents(no endless copies). 

 - List item

There is a need for more solid, trustworthy information: what are the numbers or figures around climate impact. 

So how do we get on with the campaign? We hope to keep the conversation going within the network. We publish guides about organizing and establishing a greener IT environment in your organization, e.g. making your websites more sustainable. We have a green techwatcher on board blogging about storage, green software, user dilemma’s and AI. We share tips and challenges and organize a few events about greener IT. 
This lightning talk will show some of our results within the Dutch Digital Heritage Network but will hopefully and more importantly keep the conversation going about climate impact and how to tackle this within the preservation community.

Quarantine and condition checks are a crucial part of the preservation process, ensuring that newly acquired storage media do not introduce contaminants that could harm existing collections; and that computer storage is stored, handled, and transported in a way that minimises the risk of damage or data loss.

The poster covers requirements and recommendations for five broad categories of storage media typically found in archival collections: magnetic disks, floppy disks, optical media, cassettes and tapes, and solid state. For each category, information is provided on the types of media covered as well as recommendations on the optimal environmental conditions for long-term storage. Further guidelines cover various aspects of proper media handling, best ways to safely store, visual inspections, transportation, acclimatisation, and labelling. 

This work collates and distils relevant information in British Standards BS-4783; includes updates and guidelines from the digital preservation and archiving community; and incorporates previously unpublished practice and expertise amassed in the 25 years since ASC began to collect computer storage media. It serves as a valuable resource for anyone involved in the acquisition, storage, and preservation of computer storage media in archival collections.

In this project, meemoo processed 170.000 hours of audiovisual archives using speech-to-text, named entity recognition and face recognition. We created time-based metadata identifying people, locations and organisations in audio and video. Where possible, metadata are linked to open linked authorities, such as wikidata. Over 120 partners were involved in the project, from various sectors such as digital heritage, city archives, museums and political archives. Part of this talk will be dedicated to how we involved these partners into the new but also very challenging field of creating metadata through AI. 

The lightning talk is not intended as a deep dive into technical matters. We will highlight the obtained results and discuss the quality of obtained result. But more importantly, we will explain why and how we decided to build certain components, such as face recognition, while opting to procure speech-to-text and NER services. This should give the audience an idea of the decision processes behind working with AI tooling to create descriptive metadata. We will also briefly touch the ethical and legal challenges we encountered, share insights that came out of the project.

This core set of requirements was based upon the requirements in the DPC’s procurement toolkit (https://www.dpconline.org/digipres/implement-digipres/core-requirements-for-a-digital-preservation-system). In the course of our discussions, when identifying the requirements, the question of a definition of a digital preservation solution arose. There are many definitions of digital preservation (my favourite short one is “keeping digital stuff usable”), but none for a digital preservation solution (at least not that I’ve found). A facetious response could be “A digital preservation solution enables you to keep digital stuff usable”, but that’s not really very helpful when it comes to procuring a system. 

So, what defines a digital preservation solution? We know it’s a sliding scale (with very blurred lines). Most would probably agree that backup isn’t digital preservation, but what about dark archives? They keep stuff usable in the short term, but without format migration could they really be described as proper digital preservation? Are there other decision points/getaways where on the one side there are systems that are digital preservation solutions and on the other side there are systems that don’t make the grade - sheep on the right, goats on the left.

We're interested in the communities take on this. Many people have strong opinions around definitions.

Our proposed discussion panel, titled "" Ontologies in the real world: How to make things happen?"", seeks to delve into the practical applications and challenges of implementing ontological frameworks within the broadcasting and heritage domains. Drawing upon real-world experiences and insights, our panelists will address a spectrum of key topics:

**Overcoming Implementation Hurdles**: We'll explore the complexities inherent in introducing ontologies within established suborganizations, navigating resistance to change, and fostering a culture of adaptability amidst differing operational methodologies.

**Documenting for Clarity**: Discussants will dissect the nuances of effectively documenting ontologies to mitigate misunderstandings, ensure coherence, and facilitate seamless knowledge transfer across diverse stakeholders.

**Forging Interconnections**: Delving into the intricacies of linking disparate ontologies, our panelists will elucidate strategies for harmonizing vocabularies and bridging conceptual gaps, particularly between broadcasting assets and heritage artifacts.

**Striking the Balance of Detail**: Finding the optimal level of granularity within ontological frameworks poses a significant challenge. Through case studies and best practices, we'll navigate the delicate balance between comprehensiveness and usability.

**Empowering Collaboration**: Examining the decision to permit or restrict partner organizations from crafting their own ontology subclasses, our discourse will uncover the implications for interoperability, data integrity, and collaborative innovation.

Through a blend of theoretical discourse and practical insights, our panel endeavors to equip attendees with actionable strategies, frameworks, and perspectives for navigating the multifaceted terrain of ontologies in the broadcasting and heritage sectors.

In examining the procedures for managing digital archives, the poster will take a closer look at the challenges of preserving and providing emails. The issue is currently under discussion at an international level (e.g. DeBauche et al., 2023 [iPRES], regarding French institutions: Ville, 2023). Even in German-speaking countries there are studies focussing on specific issues (e.g. Benauer, 2022), but comprehensive research addressing the various challenges has yet to be conducted.

**Study** 
Taking this situation into account, I sent out an online-questionnaire in April 2024 to the specialist communities of Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Luxembourg. Distribution channels were six relevant mailing lists. The survey provides the data basis for my current master's thesis (submission in June 2024 in Library and Information Science, Humboldt University of Berlin). The aim is to determine the current challenges and perspectives of email processing. 187 participants voted, of which 115 questionnaires are evaluable. Challenges were captured with qualitative methods (survey coding). 

**Objective of the poster contribution**
I would like to present the results at iPRES and also involve the international community. I aim to enhance participation with an interactive poster that includes a Mentimeter survey. This will not only provide insights into the unique challenges of email archiving in German-speaking countries but also extend the discussion to the international community, fostering a dialogue for making informed, long-term decisions in the field.

No specialised knowledge is required. Participants will need a smart device to fully engage with the interactive elements of the poster.

Organizations are faced with many challenges managing the technical infrastructure needed for their digital preservation storage. The National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA) Storage Survey Working Group conducted a survey in 2023 to gain an understanding of how organizations around the world manage digital preservation storage. Responses were received from 14 countries. The goal of this longitudinal study was to gather information on how new technologies and standards have impacted preservation storage and to compare results to the previous data collected in 2011, 2013, and 2019.
The survey working group reviewed questions from the previous three surveys, retaining as many questions as feasible while removing or revising those that were no longer pertinent and adding questions on current concerns, including environmental impact. The questions were thematically grouped in five sections: General Storage Environments; Geographically Distributed Copies; Preservation Storage Requirements and Services; Preservation Planning and Organizational Commitment; and Demographics.
The poster will share current trends based on key findings from the survey, including a shift away from collaborative storage models compared to previous surveys, an increase in the use of commercial cloud storage, and a greater acceptance of the use of cloud storage. The full report features a breakdown of specific cloud storage services used by institution type, statistics on self-hosting vs. outsourcing when managing digital preservation and the types of services performed, as well as information on amounts of digital storage used and plans for meeting future needs. New to the 2023 survey are questions about environmental impact, where respondents gave practical suggestions to lessen environmental impact while collections continue to grow. 
Anyone working with digital content inevitably confronts the challenge of escalating storage demands, which frequently surpass available resources.  Examining prevailing trends and learning others’ approaches to digital preservation storage can provide valuable insight, tangible examples, and facilitate the identification of shared goals and objectives, aiding in advocacy efforts.","The storage component of digital preservation is crucial for managing the growing volume of digital assets.

The Publications Office experience,2024-05-15 17:39:33.062901+00:00,Lightning Talk,Lightning talks,Approaches to Preservation,Start 2 preserve,"Trustworthy repositories of archival data need to be reliable and ensure the authenticity of their holdings. However, one aspect that is not often addressed is the verification of the completeness of these holdings.
With this lightning talk, the Publications Office will share its experience on how it ensures that the collections it archives are complete.
The Publications Office of the EU is the central point of access to EU law, as well as to publications, open data, research results, procurement notices and other official information. It plays at the same time the roles of a publishing house, a legal depository and an archive for the publications authored by the EU institutions. Among its digital collections, the ‘Official Journal of the European Union’ occupies a central place, as the digital version is legally binding since July 2013, replacing the paper edition. It thus requires particular attention in terms of authenticity and completeness.
Until now, the control of the completeness was ensured by a list established at the entrance of the archive. The filenames and checksums of all the documents ingested in the long-term preservation repository are kept in a list that is regularly compared to the inventory of the assets contained in the repository, and to their index. This way, we check if all ingested documents are still present over time and after preservation actions such as migrations, media refreshes, etc.
Recently, we made a significant change to our IT architecture by creating a reference list that is physically and conceptually separate from the archiving workflow. Most importantly, this list is fed at the entrance of the documents into the dissemination repository, i.e. at the moment where they are published (and not when they are archived). With this change, we can carry out a regular check that our archival assets are complete and intact, by comparing the filenames and checksums from the inventory to those of this new reference list. 
In short, we have established a reference list that tells the archive what it SHOULD contain, and no longer simply what the archive has received.","Reliable archival data repositories must ensure the authenticity and completeness of their collections. The Publications Office of the EU, a key access point for EU law and publications, has recently improved its method for verifying the completeness of archived documents. By creating a separate reference list at the point of publication, the Office can now regularly check that all archival assets are intact and complete.

The talk will focus on the learning curve of preserving large born digital and digitized Audio Visual (AV) records. This lightning talk will focus on the theme of “Start 2 Preserve” - how to create the bridge between best practices and real-world projects.  

This presentation will explore the results of a preservation pilot project for a collection of 14,430 AV records. From metadata cleanup to the creation of an assessment tool for selecting records for digitization, to determining standards for digitization of the AV records, creating workflows for preparing records for digitization, creation of ingest workflows for digitized AV records, and all the steps in-between.  

I hope to answer the question of: You have identified and digitized high priority AV records for preservation. How do you preserve 10, 20, 30+ TB of digitized AV records with limited resources?

While ICPSR had conducted preservation activities since its founding in 1962, it conscientiously professionalized and standardized digital preservation work after the recommendation of a 2004 external process review committee report.

This poster reviews the 20 years of digital preservation progress at ICPSR, especially highlighting upcoming funded work to modernize processes and technology to better align with responsibilities for Trustworthy Digital Repositories specified in ISO 14721 (Open Archival Information System Reference Model) and in ISO 16363 (Audit and Certification of Trustworthy Digital Repositories).  Upcoming work includes:

**Data Provenance Information**: improvement of ICPSR’s ability to track preservation actions performed on digital objects across the curation lifecycle, from deposit as Submission Information Packages through storage as Archival Information Packages. This effort includes improved documentation of relationships between original files and their associated preservation and access copies.


**File Format Identification**: integration of tools that make use of the PRONOM format registry to provide more granular and accurate information regarding the file formats of deposited data. In the case of data formats where PRONOM contains limited information or is unable to distinguish between format versions (e.g., SAS, SPSS, STATA, etc.), ICPSR intends to contribute format signature information for the benefit of the research data community.


**Technical Metadata Extraction**: expand the range of format-specific technical metadata collected by ICPSR (e.g., as defined by community resources such as the FADGI Significant Properties for Digital Video) so that this information can be made available to users (to assist with the evaluation and selection of content of interest) as well as staff (to assist with risk mediation and preservation planning).


**Metadata Interoperability**: development of a new API that will allow essential descriptive and administrative metadata about ICPSR data collections to be exported in established standards (e.g., DCAT-US, MARCXML, DDI-Codebook, Dublin Core, schema.org, etc.) to promote discovery, catalog integration, and (eventually) content transfer.","The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) established its digital preservation program nearly 20 years ago, enhancing its efforts based on a 2004 review.

The Z-100 was released by Zenith Data Systems and Heathkit in 1982.  Although it was contemporary with IBM's 5150, the ancestor of modern PCs, it is not PC-compatible, and Z-100 software can only run on that computer.  Due to the dwindling number of extent Z-100s, and the absence until now of any emulator to run Z-100 programs, a vast corpus of Z-100 data is irretrievable.

Despite similarities to the PC, such as the same processor and a variant of Microsoft DOS (""Z-DOS""), the Z-100 had many idiosyncrasies, including memory-mapped video, a second processor, and its own BIOS, ports, and interrupts.  Its video, highly advanced for the time, led to its adoption by the US Air Force and Clarkson University [3].  Much creative work was developed on this computer, including games, utilities, documents, spreadsheets, and blueprints.  Z-100 disks can be read by a modern PC with a 5 1/4"" drive; however, Z-100 programs will not run on a PC or existing emulator, and word-processing save files, BASIC files, and spreadsheets are saved in compressed, proprietary formats unreadable without their original programs.

Our Z-100 emulator, posted publicly [1], models all of the system necessary to boot Z-DOS and run many Z-100 programs.  We modeled the processors, glue logic, video, and the wrote the first timing-accurate simulation of the WD1797 floppy controller.  We tested using a monitor ROM and floppy disk images from a Z-100 in our possession.  Our emulator runs Z-DOS, most of the Z-DOS core utilities, the GALAHAD word processor, the Multiplan spreadsheet program, and Z-BASIC.  We tested disk images containing BASIC games, spreadsheets, and word documents, all saved in proprietary formats previously unreadable.  Our emulated programs opened all these data files successfully and allowed us to extract them to text files.

indico329,Exploring Preservation of Research Data and Its Context through Case Studies,2024-05-16 00:06:41.909117+00:00,Poster,Posters Meetup at Kiosk,Approaches to Preservation,From document to data,"The shift from document-centric to data-centric approaches in the research process presents new challenges and opportunities for long-term data preservation. This presentation addresses these issues by examining specific case studies below that illustrate the complexities and solutions in preserving data related to research activities. Additionally, it will discuss the growing focus on management practices, the establishment of institutional policies, and the development of project-specific Data Management Plans (DMPs).

Digital Humanities Research Data: This involves preserving text analysis and visualization scripts, as well as copyrighted content used as source data. Focus points include how to preserve and pass down complex algorithms beyond mere data organization, handle the migration of outdated visualization scripts, and manage copyright issues, including permission applications.

Linked Data and IIIF Data: This example covers databases and digital archives in the form of Linked Data and IIIF. In the background, we have original data in CSV format, transformed RDF/Turtle, and images, along with the scripts used for data organization and conversion. Key challenges include handling relatively large datasets, managing data that falls under institutional responsibility beyond individual researchers or projects, and preserving the history of data organization and interpretation despite the difficulties in drawing clear boundaries between them.

Data related to research activities should include not only research outputs, processes, and underlying resources but also documents related to the administration of research communities. This approach ensures the transparency of research practices at the community level and conveys this transparency to future generations. As an example, I will introduce the translation of documents related to research integrity, highlighting the role of web archiving technology.

To bridge generations of researchers, it is essential to develop methodologies that ensure the longevity and semantic consistency of preserved data. By exploring these case studies, we aim to identify the necessary steps and tools required to maintain the accessibility and interoperability of research data. Additionally, by considering the roles of projects and institutions, we can better ensure the successful transmission of data across generations, thus fostering a more collaborative and inclusive research environment.","The transition from document-centric to data-centric research poses various challenges and opportunities for effective long-term data preservation. This presentation will explore case studies that highlight the intricacies and strategies for safeguarding research-related data, along with the need for robust management practices and institutional policies.

Floods, a consequence of increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, have wreaked havoc on our physical archives. Roofs are leaking, and water is relentlessly damaging precious documents that hold the keys to our history. The memories of our people, stored in these fragile repositories, are fading away with every passing day.
But this isn't just a loss of the past—it's a significant impediment to our future. A nation that cannot remember where it came from cannot navigate where it is going. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which aim to create a better and more sustainable future for all, rely heavily on a country's ability to learn from its history, adapt, and innovate. Without preserving our memories, our progress towards these goals is severely hindered.
However, there is hope. Digital preservation offers a beacon of light in these dark times. By converting our physical archives into digital formats, we can protect them from the elements and ensure their longevity. Digital archives can be easily replicated and stored in multiple locations, providing a safeguard against disasters that could otherwise erase our history.
Yet, the task ahead is monumental and cannot be achieved in isolation. We are bleeding for partnerships—collaborations with governmental bodies, private sectors, international organizations, and passionate individuals.

The technology was demonstrated in 2023 via an end-to-end prototype in a data center rack size form factor. The technology uses Ceramic-on-glass sheets as media. These are stacked inside of LTO-shaped cartridges leveraging tape automation infrastructure. Cerabyte data storage withstands a number of threat scenarios and does not exhibit bit rot even at extreme temperatures or intense UV or radiation exposure. Femtosecond lasers are used to punch holes in the ceramic layer encoding the data in matrices, high-speed microscope cameras enable the readback of the data.

This entry is done by creating a Submission Information Package (SIP). In practice, this involves a .zip file that consists of a metadata file (conforming to our metadata scheme and the dossiers and items themselves. The creation and uploading of SIPs in the E-depot will be simplified because the customer can easily map their own metadata model to the DAV model, automatically read and fill in metadata in the metadata file, generate SIPs that comply with the requirements of the E-depot, and finally place the SIP on the customer's FTPS environment, after which it is picked up by the E-depot.

The first phase of the tool was created out of necessity: our clients often have to re-upload a SIP because various errors were made against our metadata model. With our SIP-Creator application we want to prevent those errors and streamline their ingest workflow. By the iPRES event, we will have completed our second phase of development. The second phase will be focused on the ingest of descriptions for analogue archive into our E-depot. This is needed because both digital material and analogue descriptions are housed in the same environment and described and accessed according to the same standard.",,Julie Jordens,Julie Jordens,,,,,2024-09-18,11:35,9 minutes,,kraakhuis,Great Preservation Bake-Off: Appetizers (Pre-Ingest),https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/3c14f516b3bb42e6808a7c66fd54429b36d34b3d55634a3fb48a382b6aaa18f0,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tSJimjLpVuNNMjbB3KZ5gPwYh7j3jrlWt1Vjsygx4yc/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)

Meemoo digitises images and audio for its content partners in cultural, media, and government sectors. We also manage the influx of their existing digital collections into our archive system, where the content is sustainably preserved. However, most material has almost no metadata attached, making it unfindable. Therefore, we have developed an AI-metadata pipeline that automatically adds metadata to video content, enhancing its searchability. This AI-driven approach helps make content findable and accessible, unlocking it for future generations.

Our AI metadata pipeline has a microservice-based architecture capable of processing large datasets while keeping processing costs low. To date, we have processed more than 150,000 hours of video material. Our facial recognition pipeline combines several open-source models for face detection (YuNet, Mediapipe) and face recognition (MagFace). For speech-to-text, we use SpeechMatics, a high-quality, multilanguage SaaS speech engine. For entity recognition and linking on the transcripts, we utilize TextRazor, a multilingual SaaS engine.

We will demonstrate the power of our pipeline by processing material from the Video Person-Clustering Dataset and the YouCook2 Dataset. This demonstration will apply facial recognition, speech-to-text, entity recognition, and entity linking models, to create AI-generated metadata and illustrate the improved searchability. While whisking in new insights and sprinkling some Generative AI (GenAI) on top, we will enable content creation and transformation, baking up the future potential of our technology.

indico361,"Ownership, Preservation & Control",,Keynote,Plenary,Legal and Social Responsibilities for DP,From document to data,"Aaron Perzanowski holds the esteemed Thomas W. Lacchia Professorship of Law at the University of Michigan Law School. His work focuses on intellectual and personal property law and the concept of ownership in the digital economy. His books include The End of Ownership, co-authored with Jason Schultz, and The Right to Repair.
In his work, Aaron examines and critiques how the market economy has shifted from the exchange of tangible goods to one of licensed access to digital media, software, and related services. This evolution has profound and far-reaching implications for digital preservation, which will be the focus of his keynote address at iPRES 2024.
Consumers can no longer rely on the purchase itself to guarantee them long-term access to digital movies, games, and other media. Farmers can no longer expect the right to repair the equipment they own, free from manufacturer interference. Libraries cannot truly guarantee patrons perpetual access to titles ostensibly in their digital collections since license arrangements can change significantly over time. And in archives, license terms might contradict the need to transcode, transform, and preserve digital materials when appropriate.
For centuries, the notion of ownership and the legal rights that flow from it have been foundational to preserving individual autonomy and preventing post-sale restrictions on the use of information goods. Digital distribution and attendant licensing structures have undermined this legal architecture without offering any suitable alternatives. Expanding our understanding of ownership to embrace digital assets might offer a path forward.
Previously, Aaron Perzanowski lectured at Case Western Reserve University, Wayne State University, and UC Berkeley School of Information. He was a visiting professor at the University of Notre Dame and a Microsoft Research Fellow at UC Berkeley School of Law.

indico362,Former Farmer Chases Traces,,Keynote,Plenary,Metadata Standards and Implementation,Scaling up,"Herbert Van de Sompel is an Honorary Fellow at Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS) in The Netherlands and Visiting Professor at the Internet Technology & Data Science Lab of Ghent University. Throughout his career, Herbert has focused on infrastructure (tools, standards, protocols) to advance open access to scholarly communication and to enable long-term archiving in a globally networked environment. He has made a wide range of contributions, including the Open Archives Initiative specifications (OAI-PMH, OAI-ORE, ResourceSync), the OpenURL reference linking framework, Web Annotation, Memento, Robust Links, COAR Notify, and the Signposting the Scholarly Web specifications. He was awarded the 2017 Paul Evan Peters Award for his lasting achievements in the creation and innovative use of network-based information resources and services to advance scholarship and intellectual productivity.
One of Herbert's key projects is Memento, a protocol and associated infrastructure that provides uniform access to archived webpages by means of their original URL, irrespective of the web archive that hosts them. With his Research & Prototyping Team at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, and in collaboration with colleagues from Old Dominion University, Herbert developed the protocol that uses the URL of an existing or vanished web page and a datetime to retrieve a prior version of the webpage, using an approach that is similar to how language or region-locked versions of webpages are retrieved. Many web archives provide a glimpse into now-deleted webpages that they have salvaged. With Memento as an enabler, navigation across these distributed web archives is possible. Moreover, Robust Links, which leverages Memento, can prevent reference rot by ensuring that the referenced webpages are archived in a timely manner and that references themselves support visiting both the archived and current webpage versions. As such, web references stay true to the citing author's original intent while also allowing assessment of how pages have evolved since they were cited.
A major motivation for Herbert's work - rooted in his early career as head of library automation at Ghent University - has been a concern with the ever-growing consolidation and monopolization of the global information infrastructure, which is apparent in the web, generally, and in research communication, specifically. And, while centralization is not harmful by definition, parties that have achieved a monopoly position can rarely avoid the temptation to abuse it. For many years now, with like-minded colleagues, Herbert has been advocating for more decentralized approaches in which interoperability provides the glue to realize a system in which communicating research instead of enriching shareholders is central. Putting scholarly communication back into the hands of the researchers is essential, as is infrastructure that allows libraries and archives to preserve the scholarly record for the long term.

In addition to working at Ghent University and the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Herbert has held positions as Visiting Professor in Computer Science at Cornell University, Director of e-Strategy and Programmes at the British Library, and Chief Innovation Officer at DANS. His work has, among others, been mentioned in the New Yorker, Nature, The Digital Preservation Newsletter, and New Scientist.",,,,,https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/hn3hd9c1/,,,2024-09-18,09:30,1 hour,,concerthall,Keynote: Former Farmer Chases Traces,https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/b69c4a5718ea4bb0bad955e127e45959d308483943a040578d5716d9b9fa6006,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P1nLtAA-diaAsRwbmgWZV9ajSo1q4geSSgBSmiM6a5k/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po,Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)
indico363,Atlas of Lost Finds,,Keynote,Plenary,Approaches to Preservation,Start 2 preserve,"Design Studio Unfold, co-founded in 2002 by Claire Warnier and Dries Verbruggen, aims to combine historical and artisanal know-how with 3D-printing technologies, and in the process, they blur the role of the designer, author, producer, and consumer. In 2017, Unfold was awarded Designer of the Year, for their “search of innovation in 3D technologies, without losing the human aspect” (quoted from the jury).
We invited Claire Warnier to give a keynote address at iPRES2024, to share what they learned on their journey. One of their key projects started after a devastating fire at the Museu Nacional in Rio de Janeiro that destroyed 90% of its 20 million artifacts. Many people across the world can still recall the horrible news images.
The Atlas of Lost Finds project has re-materialised some of the lost artifacts from available 3D scans. Locating these scans in museums around the world and refining the ceramic 3D-printing technologies was the first step. Only when the team started combining modern technology with the knowledge, techniques, and materials of traditional craftsmen, did the reproduced artifacts start to gain a new meaning. Learning more about this project will trigger critical reflections about the roles and functions of digital heritage, e.g. about the nature of digital content, open source software and hardware, ownership, and repatriation of heritage.
A Combmaker’s Tale explores a similar concept and asks: can robotics and 3D technology help preserve human craftmanship? The movie tells the story of Antun Penezić, the last artisanal combmaker of Croatia. Without an apprentice, his experience, skills and know-how would not be passed on to the next generation. Yet, by training a robot to mimic every movement involved in combmaking, Antun is transferring his skills, but is the robot also becoming an apprentice?
The work of Unfold is in the collection of Design Museum Ghent and has been presented by Design Museum London, Museum of Arts and Design New York, Z33 House for Contemporary Art, and others. Moreover, their work has been featured in the New York Times, Journal of Modern Craft, International Herald Tribune and more.
