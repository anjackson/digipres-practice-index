This year the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP) celebrates a decade of digital preservation actions and discovery, working with a network of over 170 partners resulting in over 200 terabytes of all types of important digital content. Collectively, we have built lasting relationships, helped facilitate natural networks within the overall NDIIPP network, and tested new tools and services that support the work of the partners in the network. We will rely on the collective wisdom of our partners as we grapple with the challenges of curating and serving a digital collection as rich and diverse as the Twitter archive."], "dc_format": ["application/pdf"], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.185350", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:185350"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_rights": ["GPLv3", "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt"], "dc_license": ["GPLv3", "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt"], "dc_subject_eng": ["iPRES", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2010 (001005)"], "keyword_suggest": ["iPRES", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2010 (001005)"], "dc_title": ["DIGITAL PRESERVATION: THE TWITTER ARCHIVES AND NDIIPP: Paper - iPres 2010 - Vienna"], "dc_title_eng": ["DIGITAL PRESERVATION: THE TWITTER ARCHIVES AND NDIIPP: Paper - iPres 2010 - Vienna"], "dc_type_eng": ["article in collected edition"], "modified": "2017-03-03T11:42:44.326Z", "object_type_id": ["http://phaidra.univie.ac.at/XML/metadata/lom/V1.0/organization/voc_17/1552263"], "owner": "raubera5", "pid": "o:185350", "resourcetype": "text", "size": 46110.0, "title_suggest": ["DIGITAL PRESERVATION: THE TWITTER ARCHIVES AND NDIIPP: Paper - iPres 2010 - Vienna", "DIGITAL PRESERVATION: THE TWITTER ARCHIVES AND NDIIPP: Paper - iPres 2010 - Vienna"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Laura E.\",\"lastname\":\"Campbell\"},{\"data_order\":\"1\",\"firstname\":\"Beth\",\"lastname\":\"Dulabahn\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2012-09-27T11:20:40.846Z"], "_version_": 1761125919987073024, "ispartof": ["o:245914"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "DIGITAL PRESERVATION: THE TWITTER ARCHIVES AND NDIIPP: Paper - iPres 2010 - Vienna", "sort_dc_title": "DIGITAL PRESERVATION: THE TWITTER ARCHIVES AND NDIIPP: Paper - iPres 2010 - Vienna", "tsize": [46110.0], "tmodified": ["2017-03-03T11:42:44.326Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:245914", "__source_name": "ipres2010", "__year": 2010}
