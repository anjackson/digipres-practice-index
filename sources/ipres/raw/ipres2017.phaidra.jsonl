Anyone who works with software understands that applications come and go, and even those that last many years go through numerous upgrades and re-architectures as they try to keep up with the latest technological advances. This flux creates a problem: how do we efficiently move our data through changing software and version upgrades as losslessly as possible? The Fedora community recently confronted this problem, which led to the development of a tool that could have broad utility for data migrations.\nFedora is a flexible, extensible, open source repository platform for managing, preserving, and providing access to digital content. Fedora has gone through several major version upgrades since its initial conception almost 20 years ago, most recently with the move to Fedora 4. Fedora 4 is a complete software re-architecture, which necessitates a data migration from previous versions of Fedora. This experience led the Fedora community to focus on making it as easy as possible to get data into and out of Fedora in standard formats, an effort that culminated in the creation of an import/export utility that standardizes on RDF and the BagIt specification to transfer data between versions of Fedora as well as external preservation systems. This effort coincides with a recently chartered Research Data Alliance working group with a mandate to explore technologies and standards for interoperability between repository platforms and make recommendations on this topic. The group is exploring the Fedora import/export utility as a possible basis for broader interoperability between diverse repository platforms by building on this standard import/export functionality. This paper will provide an overview of the import/export efforts that have taken place so far, and discuss how we might achieve broader interoperability and ease data migrations through the work of the RDA Research Data Repository Interoperability working group."], "dc_description_eng": ["Software is transient: it\u2019s the data that matter. Anyone who works with software understands that applications come and go, and even those that last many years go through numerous upgrades and re-architectures as they try to keep up with the latest technological advances. This flux creates a problem: how do we efficiently move our data through changing software and version upgrades as losslessly as possible? The Fedora community recently confronted this problem, which led to the development of a tool that could have broad utility for data migrations.\nFedora is a flexible, extensible, open source repository platform for managing, preserving, and providing access to digital content.

As a part of the method, a simple ontology of key elements (named entities) in bibliographic data is constructed along general bibliographic rules for historical heritage. The ontology also has a capability to describe relations between a book and its parts. This allows mechanical access to information such as a creator of a cover picture, preface and so on. Finally, a script creates connections from named entities to URIs which describe headings or glossaries provided online by public organizations."], "dc_format": ["application/pdf"], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.931094", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:931094"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY-SA 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY-SA 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"], "dc_subject_eng": ["iPRES, Kyoto", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2017 (001012)"], "keyword_suggest": ["iPRES, Kyoto", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2017 (001012)"], "dc_title": ["Semi-automated Generation of Linked Data from Unstructured Bibliographic Data for Japanese Historical Rare Books"], "dc_title_eng": ["Semi-automated Generation of Linked Data from Unstructured Bibliographic Data for Japanese Historical Rare Books"], "dc_type_eng": ["article in collected edition"], "modified": "2019-02-20T19:47:59.107Z", "object_type_id": ["http://phaidra.univie.ac.at/XML/metadata/lom/V1.0/organization/voc_17/1552263"], "owner": "ipresu42", "pid": "o:931094", "resourcetype": "text", "size": 166124.0, "title_suggest": ["Semi-automated Generation of Linked Data from Unstructured Bibliographic Data for Japanese Historical Rare Books", "Semi-automated Generation of Linked Data from Unstructured Bibliographic Data for Japanese Historical Rare Books"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Natsuko\",\"lastname\":\"Yoshiga\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"1\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Shin-Ichi\",\"lastname\":\"Tadaki\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2019-02-20T19:21:01.782Z"], "_version_": 1761123401829711872, "ispartof": ["o:168770", "o:424738", "o:931148"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "Semi-automated Generation of Linked Data from Unstructured Bibliographic Data for Japanese Historical Rare Books", "sort_dc_title": "Semi-automated Generation of Linked Data from Unstructured Bibliographic Data for Japanese Historical Rare Books", "tsize": [166124.0], "tmodified": ["2019-02-20T19:47:59.107Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:931148", "__source_name": "iPRES", "__year": 2017}

As the world\u2019s most comprehensive digital library collection of legacy biodiversity literature, the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) is dedicated to building and maintaining their repository by determining the scope of biodiversity literature and analyzing the collection strengths, weaknesses and gaps in the BHL corpus [1]. Regular analyses have been performed since the creation of BHL in 2006 and as the corpus expands and methods for analyzing literature in the public domain develop, continuous analysis of BHL coverage and gaps remains critical. In the course of 2017, BHL has the opportunity to work with a team of National Digital Stewardship Residents who are committed to developing a plan for the next generation of BHL.\nThis poster will illustrate the current research and progress of the collection analysis project of the National Digital Stewardship Resident (NDSR) project led by the resident hosted at the Chicago Botanic Garden\u2019s Lenhardt Library."], "dc_format": ["application/pdf"], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.931134", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:931134"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY-SA 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY-SA 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"], "dc_subject_eng": ["iPRES, Kyoto, Poster", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2017 (001012)"], "keyword_suggest": ["iPRES, Kyoto, Poster", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2017 (001012)"], "dc_title": ["Performing a Content Analysis of Biodiversity Literature"], "dc_title_eng": ["Performing a Content Analysis of Biodiversity Literature"], "dc_type_eng": ["article in collected edition"], "modified": "2019-02-21T10:27:32.531Z", "object_type_id": ["http://phaidra.univie.ac.at/XML/metadata/lom/V1.0/organization/voc_17/1552263"], "owner": "ipresu42", "pid": "o:931134", "resourcetype": "text", "size": 105252.0, "title_suggest": ["Performing a Content Analysis of Biodiversity Literature", "Performing a Content Analysis of Biodiversity Literature"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Alicia\",\"lastname\":\"Esquivel\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2019-02-21T09:43:54.536Z"], "_version_": 1761123549694656512, "ispartof": ["o:168770", "o:424738", "o:931148"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "Performing a Content Analysis of Biodiversity Literature", "sort_dc_title": "Performing a Content Analysis of Biodiversity Literature", "tsize": [105252.0], "tmodified": ["2019-02-21T10:27:32.531Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:931148", "__source_name": "iPRES", "__year": 2017}
