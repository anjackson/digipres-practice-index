We construct a database from administrative records containing information about thousands of social science studies that have been conducted over the last 40 years. Included in the database are descriptions of social science data collections funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. Using a subset of these awards, we conduct a survey of principal investigators (n=1,021). We find that very few social science data collections are preserved and disseminated by an archive or institutional repository. Informal sharing of data in the social sciences is much more common.

We construct a database from administrative records containing information about thousands of social science studies that have been conducted over the last 40 years. Included in the database are descriptions of social science data collections funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. Using a subset of these awards, we conduct a survey of principal investigators (n=1,021). We find that very few social science data collections are preserved and disseminated by an archive or institutional repository. Informal sharing of data in the social sciences is much more common.

We explain how differences in input and output formats and methods influence the development of an emulator and that, depending on the original system, the transfer of data between the emulated environment and the host environment enforces implicit migration of the data to become usable."], "dc_format": ["application/pdf"], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.294242", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294242"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY-SA 3.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/at/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY-SA 3.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/at/"], "dc_subject_eng": ["iPRES, Singapore", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2011 (001006)"], "keyword_suggest": ["iPRES, Singapore", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2011 (001006)"], "dc_title": ["Design Decisions in Emulator Construction: A Case Study on Home Computer Software Preservation: Paper - iPRES 2011 - Singapore"], "dc_title_eng": ["Design Decisions in Emulator Construction: A Case Study on Home Computer Software Preservation: Paper - iPRES 2011 - Singapore"], "dc_type_eng": ["Text"], "modified": "2017-03-02T02:39:21.403Z", "owner": "kellerc2", "pid": "o:294242", "resourcetype": "text", "size": 2225080.0, "title_suggest": ["Design Decisions in Emulator Construction: A Case Study on Home Computer Software Preservation: Paper - iPRES 2011 - Singapore", "Design Decisions in Emulator Construction: A Case Study on Home Computer Software Preservation: Paper - iPRES 2011 - Singapore"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Mark\",\"lastname\":\"Guttenbrunner\"},{\"data_order\":\"1\",\"firstname\":\"Andreas\",\"lastname\":\"Rauber\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2013-06-26T07:38:03.733Z"], "_version_": 1761118735980036096, "ispartof": ["o:168770", "o:294299", "o:424738"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "Design Decisions in Emulator Construction: A Case Study on Home Computer Software Preservation: Paper - iPRES 2011 - Singapore", "sort_dc_title": "Design Decisions in Emulator Construction: A Case Study on Home Computer Software Preservation: Paper - iPRES 2011 - Singapore", "tsize": [2225080.0], "tmodified": ["2017-03-02T02:39:21.403Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:294299", "__source_name": "iPRES", "__year": 2011}

POCOS aims to promote broader appreciation of the state-of-the art in preserving complex objects, provide input to collections management and create fertile ground for future collaborations between academia and industry."], "dc_format": ["application/pdf"], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.294276", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294276"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY-SA 3.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/at/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY-SA 3.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/at/"], "dc_subject_eng": ["iPRES, Singapore, complex visual objects, digital preservation, software art, simulations and visualizations, gaming environments", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2011 (001006)"], "keyword_suggest": ["iPRES, Singapore, complex visual objects, digital preservation, software art, simulations and visualizations, gaming environments", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2011 (001006)"], "dc_title": ["Capitalizing on the State-of-the-Art in Preserving Complex Visual Digital Objects: The POCOS Project: Paper - iPRES 2011 - Singapore"], "dc_title_eng": ["Capitalizing on the State-of-the-Art in Preserving Complex Visual Digital Objects: The POCOS Project: Paper - iPRES 2011 - Singapore"], "dc_type_eng": ["Text"], "modified": "2017-03-02T02:37:25.309Z", "owner": "kellerc2", "pid": "o:294276", "resourcetype": "text", "size": 475515.0, "title_suggest": ["Capitalizing on the State-of-the-Art in Preserving Complex Visual Digital Objects: The POCOS Project: Paper - iPRES 2011 - Singapore", "Capitalizing on the State-of-the-Art in Preserving Complex Visual Digital Objects: The POCOS Project: Paper - iPRES 2011 - Singapore"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Leo\",\"lastname\":\"Konstantelos\"},{\"data_order\":\"8\",\"firstname\":\"David\",\"lastname\":\"Anderson\"},{\"data_order\":\"7\",\"firstname\":\"Richard\",\"lastname\":\"Beacham\"},{\"data_order\":\"6\",\"firstname\":\"Vincent\",\"lastname\":\"Joguin\"},{\"data_order\":\"5\",\"firstname\":\"Sonia\",\"lastname\":\"S\u00e9fi\"},{\"data_order\":\"4\",\"firstname\":\"Janet\",\"lastname\":\"Delve\"},{\"data_order\":\"3\",\"firstname\":\"Milena\",\"lastname\":\"Dobreva\"},{\"data_order\":\"2\",\"firstname\":\"Clive\",\"lastname\":\"Billenness\"},{\"data_order\":\"1\",\"firstname\":\"Drew\",\"lastname\":\"Baker\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2013-06-26T10:37:21.825Z"], "_version_": 1761118740335820800, "ispartof": ["o:168770", "o:294299", "o:424738"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "Capitalizing on the State-of-the-Art in Preserving Complex Visual Digital Objects: The POCOS Project: Paper - iPRES 2011 - Singapore", "sort_dc_title": "Capitalizing on the State-of-the-Art in Preserving Complex Visual Digital Objects: The POCOS Project: Paper - iPRES 2011 - Singapore", "tsize": [475515.0], "tmodified": ["2017-03-02T02:37:25.309Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:294299", "__source_name": "iPRES", "__year": 2011}

Using a GPU with the CUDA architecture allows the creation of a parallel processing service with enhanced scalability. The Braille converter is a web service that provides automatic conversion from the older BRF to the newer PEF Braille format. This service can manage a large number of objects. Speedups on the order of magnitude of 5000 to 6900 (depending on the size of the object) were achieved using a GPU (GTX460 graphics card) with respect to a CPU implementation. An extension involving an image processing system is used for human interaction. Optical pattern recognition allows Braille code creation using Braille patterns. No special input device and skills are needed, only familiarity with Braille code is required."], "dc_format": ["application/pdf"], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.294245", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294245"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY-SA 3.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/at/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY-SA 3.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/at/"], "dc_subject_eng": ["iPRES, Singapore, digital preservation, CUDA, performance measurement, information retrieval, image processing, haptic I/O", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2011 (001006)"], "keyword_suggest": ["iPRES, Singapore, digital preservation, CUDA, performance measurement, information retrieval, image processing, haptic I/O", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2011 (001006)"], "dc_title": ["A Braille Conversion Service Using GPU and Human Interaction by Computer Vision: Paper - iPRES 2011 - Singapore"], "dc_title_eng": ["A Braille Conversion Service Using GPU and Human Interaction by Computer Vision: Paper - iPRES 2011 - Singapore"], "dc_type_eng": ["Text"], "modified": "2017-03-02T02:39:12.788Z", "owner": "kellerc2", "pid": "o:294245", "resourcetype": "text", "size": 743898.0, "title_suggest": ["A Braille Conversion Service Using GPU and Human Interaction by Computer Vision: Paper - iPRES 2011 - Singapore", "A Braille Conversion Service Using GPU and Human Interaction by Computer Vision: Paper - iPRES 2011 - Singapore"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Roman\",\"lastname\":\"Graf\"},{\"data_order\":\"1\",\"firstname\":\"Reinhold\",\"lastname\":\"Huber-M\u00f6rk\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2013-06-26T07:50:23.206Z"], "_version_": 1761118735585771520, "ispartof": ["o:168770", "o:294299", "o:424738"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "A Braille Conversion Service Using GPU and Human Interaction by Computer Vision: Paper - iPRES 2011 - Singapore", "sort_dc_title": "A Braille Conversion Service Using GPU and Human Interaction by Computer Vision: Paper - iPRES 2011 - Singapore", "tsize": [743898.0], "tmodified": ["2017-03-02T02:39:12.788Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:294299", "__source_name": "iPRES", "__year": 2011}

The total sum of purchasing software, hardware and external services amounted to around 135.000 Euros.\nThe project migrated data from both relational and hierarchical databases (for instance ERDMS and registries), and included the digitisation of audio, video as well as paper documentation. The registries counted for example the first Civil Registration System from 1968 and the State Tax Administration's final equation from 1970. Data and documentation made up a total of about 1.7 TB, consisted of 11,187 files scattered in almost 200 different structures, and constituted more than 2,000 information packages (IPs).\nThe overall technical objective of the migration was defined by the aforementioned preservation standard, which required:\n\u2022 Common format for data files\n\u2022 Common structure of  documentation, metadata and documents\n\u2022 Common format for documents (TIFF).\nThe project's main objectives were achieved, since all records were migrated, except the film collection.

Some indication will also be given as to where collective international effort may be of universal benefit."], "dc_format": ["application/pdf"], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.294223", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294223"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY-SA 3.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/at/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY-SA 3.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/at/"], "dc_subject_eng": ["iPRES, Singapore, preservation, costs, economics, models", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2011 (001006)"], "keyword_suggest": ["iPRES, Singapore, preservation, costs, economics, models", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2011 (001006)"], "dc_title": ["The Costs and Economics of Preservation: Paper - iPRES 2011 - Singapore"], "dc_title_eng": ["The Costs and Economics of Preservation: Paper - iPRES 2011 - Singapore"], "dc_type_eng": ["Text"], "modified": "2017-03-02T02:40:08.049Z", "owner": "kellerc2", "pid": "o:294223", "resourcetype": "text", "size": 581218.0, "title_suggest": ["The Costs and Economics of Preservation: Paper - iPRES 2011 - Singapore", "The Costs and Economics of Preservation: Paper - iPRES 2011 - Singapore"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Neil\",\"lastname\":\"Grindley\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2013-06-25T13:30:40.663Z"], "_version_": 1761117671643938816, "ispartof": ["o:168770", "o:294299", "o:424738"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "The Costs and Economics of Preservation: Paper - iPRES 2011 - Singapore", "sort_dc_title": "The Costs and Economics of Preservation: Paper - iPRES 2011 - Singapore", "tsize": [581218.0], "tmodified": ["2017-03-02T02:40:08.049Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:294299", "__source_name": "iPRES", "__year": 2011}

In doing so, they assume that the establishment of a network of trusted digital archives will create a climate of trust.
