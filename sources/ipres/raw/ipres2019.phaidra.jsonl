Yet the length of time knowledge needs to be accessible and understandable, the accountability for public safety, and non-proliferation concerns present further challenges in the preservation of information related to nuclear science and its applications. Preservation efforts in this field must be approached and executed with these challenges in mind while also aligning with community good practices. \nPractitioners from the nuclear field will present their experiences and. the panel discussion will address collaboration and impediments, appraisal and records management in light of the length of time material must be available, and preservation\napproaches. The panel will demonstrate the ways in which those in the nuclear field benefit from and apply good preservation practices and highlight how practitioners in the nuclear field can contribute to the broader digital preservation community thus opening a dialogue on how we can progress together."], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.1080469", "doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/YNGUE", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:1080469"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"], "dc_subject_eng": ["Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2019 (001014)"], "keyword_suggest": ["Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2019 (001014)"], "dc_title": ["Achieving Criticality of Preservation Knowledge - iPRES 2019 Amsterdam"], "dc_title_eng": ["Achieving Criticality of Preservation Knowledge - iPRES 2019 Amsterdam"], "dc_type_eng": ["Text"], "modified": "2020-05-08T10:03:21.757Z", "owner": "ipresu86", "pid": "o:1080469", "resourcetype": "text", "size": 127504.0, "title_suggest": ["Achieving Criticality of Preservation Knowledge - iPRES 2019 Amsterdam", "Achieving Criticality of Preservation Knowledge - iPRES 2019 Amsterdam"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Jim\",\"lastname\":\"Moye\"},{\"data_order\":\"1\",\"firstname\":\"Jenny\",\"lastname\":\"Mitcham\"},{\"data_order\":\"2\",\"firstname\":\"William\",\"lastname\":\"Kilbride\"},{\"data_order\":\"3\",\"firstname\":\"Elizabeth\",\"lastname\":\"Kata\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2020-05-08T09:36:31.011Z"], "_version_": 1761119669697118208, "ispartof": ["o:1049636", "o:168770", "o:424738"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "Achieving Criticality of Preservation Knowledge - iPRES 2019 Amsterdam", "sort_dc_title": "Achieving Criticality of Preservation Knowledge - iPRES 2019 Amsterdam", "tsize": [127504.0], "tmodified": ["2020-05-08T10:03:21.757Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:1049636", "__source_name": "ipres2019", "__year": 2019}

This is probably one of the reasons why there exist numerous examples of metadata being under backup only and not under bit preservation. \nPreservation of metadata is not just needed for future access of the objects, but also for re-establishment of repository systems after major breakdowns \u2013 or for establishment of a new repository as part of an exit strategy from a previous system. The latter case\nmay also mean that the metadata have to be structured in a way, which can be used by different systems supporting digital preservation.\nThis paper describes how the newly merged Royal Danish Library has created a digital preservation strategy to cope with these challenges, and discusses the background for choices made in this process."], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.1079747", "doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/NGY4U", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:1079747"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"], "dc_subject_eng": ["Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2019 (001014)"], "keyword_suggest": ["Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2019 (001014)"], "dc_title": ["Preservation of Metadata - iPRES 2019 Amsterdam"], "dc_title_eng": ["Preservation of Metadata - iPRES 2019 Amsterdam"], "dc_type_eng": ["Text"], "modified": "2020-04-26T10:00:14.425Z", "owner": "ipresu86", "pid": "o:1079747", "resourcetype": "text", "size": 441987.0, "title_suggest": ["Preservation of Metadata - iPRES 2019 Amsterdam", "Preservation of Metadata - iPRES 2019 Amsterdam"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Eld\",\"lastname\":\"Zierau\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2020-04-26T09:53:56.874Z"], "_version_": 1761119937994162177, "ispartof": ["o:1049636", "o:168770", "o:424738"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "Preservation of Metadata - iPRES 2019 Amsterdam", "sort_dc_title": "Preservation of Metadata - iPRES 2019 Amsterdam", "tsize": [441987.0], "tmodified": ["2020-04-26T10:00:14.425Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:1049636", "__source_name": "ipres2019", "__year": 2019}

Enabling this has, to date, been a difficult, time-consuming, relatively resource intensive, and tedious. In this paper, we show how we are on the verge of creating a new method and series of tools to simplify and automate the process of interacting with digital objects in their original software and greatly reduce the time and resource costs of doing so. We outline the history of the developments in the areas of emulation and software preservation that we have built on and we outline the concept of this set of tools and processes we call the \u201cUniversal Virtual Interactor\u201d. We also discuss how the UVI is being created, and finally we discuss how it may be improved upon in the future and how it may be implemented in access and discovery tools."], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.1081742", "doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/AZEWJ", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:1081742"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"], "dc_subject_eng": ["Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2019 (001014)"], "keyword_suggest": ["Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2019 (001014)"], "dc_title": ["Towards a Universal Virtual Interactor (UVI) for Digital Objects - iPRES 2019 Amsterdam"], "dc_title_eng": ["Towards a Universal Virtual Interactor (UVI) for Digital Objects - iPRES 2019 Amsterdam"], "dc_type_eng": ["Text"], "modified": "2020-05-14T14:52:20.354Z", "owner": "ipresu86", "pid": "o:1081742", "resourcetype": "text", "size": 424158.0, "title_suggest": ["Towards a Universal Virtual Interactor (UVI) for Digital Objects - iPRES 2019 Amsterdam", "Towards a Universal Virtual Interactor (UVI) for Digital Objects - iPRES 2019 Amsterdam"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Jessica\",\"lastname\":\"Meyerson\"},{\"data_order\":\"1\",\"firstname\":\"Klaus\",\"lastname\":\"Rechert\"},{\"data_order\":\"2\",\"firstname\":\"Ethan\",\"lastname\":\"Gates\"},{\"data_order\":\"3\",\"firstname\":\"Seth\",\"lastname\":\"Anderson\"},{\"data_order\":\"4\",\"firstname\":\"Euan\",\"lastname\":\"Cochrane\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2020-05-14T14:25:48.601Z"], "_version_": 1761120177218387968, "ispartof": ["o:1049636", "o:168770", "o:424738"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "Towards a Universal Virtual Interactor (UVI) for Digital Objects - iPRES 2019 Amsterdam", "sort_dc_title": "Towards a Universal Virtual Interactor (UVI) for Digital Objects - iPRES 2019 Amsterdam", "tsize": [424158.0], "tmodified": ["2020-05-14T14:52:20.354Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:1049636", "__source_name": "ipres2019", "__year": 2019}
