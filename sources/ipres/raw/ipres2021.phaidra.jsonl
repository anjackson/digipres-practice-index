In this paper, we will design a collaborative tagging model, which uses the content of user's spontaneous tagging as the basis, through the three stages of self-use tag, collective tag audit and public tag, to supplement the collection information and improve the efficiency of digital resource retrieval.\n"], "dc_format": ["application/pdf"], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.1424916", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:1424916"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"], "dc_subject_eng": ["Collaborative tagging, Tag, Information organization, User generated content", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2021 (001016)"], "keyword_suggest": ["Collaborative tagging, Tag, Information organization, User generated content", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2021 (001016)"], "dc_title": ["The Design of Collaborative Marking Mode for Museum Collections-Taking \"gugong minghuaji\" as an example"], "dc_title_eng": ["The Design of Collaborative Marking Mode for Museum Collections-Taking \"gugong minghuaji\" as an example"], "dc_type_eng": ["Text"], "modified": "2022-02-23T09:11:30.888Z", "owner": "ipresarchiv1", "pid": "o:1424916", "resourcetype": "text", "size": 542664.0, "title_suggest": ["The Design of Collaborative Marking Mode for Museum Collections-Taking \"gugong minghuaji\" as an example", "The Design of Collaborative Marking Mode for Museum Collections-Taking \"gugong minghuaji\" as an example"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Sun\",\"institution\":\"The Palace Museum\",\"lastname\":\"Jing\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2022-02-23T08:40:41.741Z"], "_version_": 1761131714885713920, "ispartof": ["o:1417044", "o:168770", "o:424738"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "The Design of Collaborative Marking Mode for Museum Collections-Taking \"gugong minghuaji\" as an example", "sort_dc_title": "The Design of Collaborative Marking Mode for Museum Collections-Taking \"gugong minghuaji\" as an example", "tsize": [542664.0], "tmodified": ["2022-02-23T09:11:30.888Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:1417044", "__source_name": "iPRES", "__year": 2021}

This type of web archiving can be done by using the suite of open source tools to capture interactive websites and replay them at a later time as accurately as possible on one\u2019s own computer. \n\nWebrecorder project builds tools that specialize in a \u2018user-driven\u2019 form of web archiving, where the user is able to direct the archiving process through their browser. The goal of Webrecorder has been to build quality open source tools to enable \u2018web archiving for all\u2019 to allow anyone with a browser to create their own web archives, and to accurately replay them at a later time.\n\nWebrecorder project intends to support the creation of lots of small, decentralized archives by individuals and institutions. Rather than supporting a single centralized silo, a key goal remains to support web archives in a variety of environment and storage scenarios. From users\u2019 personal laptops, to google drive, to IPFS, Webrecorder tools will be designed to support creating and accessing web archives wherever they may be found.\n\nThrough this workshop participants will gain a working knowledge on how web archiving works by using a simple web archiving process from capture to replay on a user\u2019s local computer by using two open-source tools from Webrecorder: archiveweb.page and replayweb.page. \n\nArchiveweb.page is an open-source web archiving capture tool that turns your browser into a full-featured interactive web archiving system. It is available as an extension for any Chrome or Chromium based browsers and as a standalone app. \n\nReplayweb.page is an open-source browser-based viewer that loads web archive files provided by the user and renders them for replay in the browser. It functions as a serverless (client-side) web archive replay tool.\n\nBoth these tools combined create high-fidelity web archives using a basic workflow from capture to replay that participants can control, save, and embed onto other platforms. All the code can be viewed and accessed via the Webrecorder github: http://github.com/webrecorder/\n\nAttendees will benefit from this workshop by gaining the ability to create high fidelity captures to make collections that they\u2019ll have full autonomy over and can manage on their own devices and services. This session includes step-by-step installation help for both archiveweb.page and replayweb.page from the Webrecorder team. There will be a tutorial on how to analyze the website before capturing pages as well as breakdown to better understand components of the practice of web archiving and explore how they can fit into existing and emerging digital preservation workflows.\n\nThe target audience members for this type of workshop include: researchers, archivists, librarians, other practitioners working with digital materials, and developers.

Our outcomes are an evaluation of the output using quantitative and qualitative methods, a working 3D metadata schema for access and preservation, and an access platform for our 3D models.\n"], "dc_format": ["application/pdf"], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.1424939", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:1424939"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"], "dc_subject_eng": ["digital preservation, 3D curation, 3D access, 3D metadata, 3D modeling", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2021 (001016)"], "keyword_suggest": ["digital preservation, 3D curation, 3D access, 3D metadata, 3D modeling", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2021 (001016)"], "dc_title": ["3D Preservation Models and Modalities: Advancing Research Reproducibility and Capacity at Virginia Tech"], "dc_title_eng": ["3D Preservation Models and Modalities: Advancing Research Reproducibility and Capacity at Virginia Tech"], "dc_type_eng": ["Text"], "modified": "2022-02-23T10:35:24.675Z", "owner": "ipresarchiv1", "pid": "o:1424939", "resourcetype": "text", "size": 208635.0, "title_suggest": ["3D Preservation Models and Modalities: Advancing Research Reproducibility and Capacity at Virginia Tech", "3D Preservation Models and Modalities: Advancing Research Reproducibility and Capacity at Virginia Tech"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Alex\",\"institution\":\"Virginia Tech\",\"lastname\":\"Kinnaman\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"1\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Maureen\",\"institution\":\"Virginia Tech\",\"lastname\":\"Saverot\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"2\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Yinlin\",\"institution\":\"Virginia Tech\",\"lastname\":\"Chen\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"3\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Kara\",\"institution\":\"Virginia Tech\",\"lastname\":\"Long\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"4\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Nicholas\",\"institution\":\"Virginia Tech\",\"lastname\":\"Polys\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"5\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Sterling\",\"institution\":\"Virginia Tech\",\"lastname\":\"Nesbit\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"6\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Michelle\",\"institution\":\"Virginia Tech\",\"lastname\":\"Stocker\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"7\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Shuhai\",\"institution\":\"Virginia Tech\",\"lastname\":\"Xiao\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"8\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Nathan\",\"institution\":\"Virginia Tech\",\"lastname\":\"Hall\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2022-02-23T10:04:03.092Z"], "_version_": 1761131704553046016, "ispartof": ["o:1417044", "o:168770", "o:424738"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "3D Preservation Models and Modalities: Advancing Research Reproducibility and Capacity at Virginia Tech", "sort_dc_title": "3D Preservation Models and Modalities: Advancing Research Reproducibility and Capacity at Virginia Tech", "tsize": [208635.0], "tmodified": ["2022-02-23T10:35:24.675Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:1417044", "__source_name": "iPRES", "__year": 2021}
