Sample code paths for working with and validating block checksums are also demonstrated.\""], "dc_format": ["application/pdf"], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.923643", "doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/Y4Z3E", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:923643"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"], "dc_subject_eng": ["iPres 2018, Boston ", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2018 (001013)"], "keyword_suggest": ["iPres 2018, Boston ", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2018 (001013)"], "dc_title": ["Checksums on Modern Filesystems, or: On the virtuous consumption of CPU cycles: iPres 2018 - Boston"], "dc_title_eng": ["Checksums on Modern Filesystems, or: On the virtuous consumption of CPU cycles: iPres 2018 - Boston"], "dc_type_eng": ["Text"], "modified": "2019-01-05T16:28:41.468Z", "owner": "ipresu18", "pid": "o:923643", "resourcetype": "text", "size": 168082.0, "title_suggest": ["Checksums on Modern Filesystems, or: On the virtuous consumption of CPU cycles: iPres 2018 - Boston", "Checksums on Modern Filesystems, or: On the virtuous consumption of CPU cycles: iPres 2018 - Boston"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Alex \",\"lastname\":\"Garnett\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"1\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Justin \",\"lastname\":\"Simpson\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"2\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Mike \",\"lastname\":\"Winter\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2019-01-05T16:13:22.220Z"], "_version_": 1761122339841376256, "ispartof": ["o:168770", "o:424738", "o:988723"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "Checksums on Modern Filesystems, or: On the virtuous consumption of CPU cycles: iPres 2018 - Boston", "sort_dc_title": "Checksums on Modern Filesystems, or: On the virtuous consumption of CPU cycles: iPres 2018 - Boston", "tsize": [168082.0], "tmodified": ["2019-01-05T16:28:41.468Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:988723", "__source_name": "iPRES", "__year": 2018}

This data is permanently preserved through peer-to-peer distribution and consensus checking without the need for a trusted third party.\""], "dc_format": ["application/pdf"], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.923629", "doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/KEFJ8", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:923629"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"], "dc_subject_eng": ["iPres 2018, Boston ", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2018 (001013)"], "keyword_suggest": ["iPres 2018, Boston ", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2018 (001013)"], "dc_title": ["Using blockchain to engender trust in public digital archives: iPres 2018 - Boston"], "dc_title_eng": ["Using blockchain to engender trust in public digital archives: iPres 2018 - Boston"], "dc_type_eng": ["Text"], "modified": "2019-01-05T15:17:56.895Z", "owner": "ipresu18", "pid": "o:923629", "resourcetype": "text", "size": 141098.0, "title_suggest": ["Using blockchain to engender trust in public digital archives: iPres 2018 - Boston", "Using blockchain to engender trust in public digital archives: iPres 2018 - Boston"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Alex\",\"lastname\":\" Green\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"1\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Mark \",\"lastname\":\"Bell\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"2\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"John \",\"lastname\":\"Sheridan\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"3\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"John \",\"lastname\":\"Collomosse\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"4\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Tu \",\"lastname\":\"Bui\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"5\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Alan \",\"lastname\":\"Brown\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"6\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Jamie \",\"lastname\":\"Fawcett\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"7\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Olivier \",\"lastname\":\"Thereaux\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"8\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Jeni \",\"lastname\":\"Tennison\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2019-01-05T15:01:53.628Z"], "_version_": 1761122335676432384, "ispartof": ["o:168770", "o:424738", "o:988723"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "Using blockchain to engender trust in public digital archives: iPres 2018 - Boston", "sort_dc_title": "Using blockchain to engender trust in public digital archives: iPres 2018 - Boston", "tsize": [141098.0], "tmodified": ["2019-01-05T15:17:56.895Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:988723", "__source_name": "iPRES", "__year": 2018}

We hope to provide guidance for those who are moving forward with \u201cgood enough\u201d approaches instead of waiting for some magical day when we have all the time, staffing, and expertise to give our full attention and care to each filestream.\""], "dc_format": ["application/pdf"], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.923614", "doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/9T7Y2", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:923614"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"], "dc_subject_eng": ["iPres 2018, Boston ", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2018 (001013)"], "keyword_suggest": ["iPres 2018, Boston ", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2018 (001013)"], "dc_title": ["The evolution of digital preservation at the Getty Research Institute: How workflows have evolved in the past five years to address our varied needs: iPres 2018 - Boston"], "dc_title_eng": ["The evolution of digital preservation at the Getty Research Institute: How workflows have evolved in the past five years to address our varied needs: iPres 2018 - Boston"], "dc_type_eng": ["Text"], "modified": "2019-01-04T16:05:53.736Z", "owner": "ipresu18", "pid": "o:923614", "resourcetype": "text", "size": 55263.0, "title_suggest": ["The evolution of digital preservation at the Getty Research Institute: How workflows have evolved in the past five years to address our varied needs: iPres 2018 - Boston", "The evolution of digital preservation at the Getty Research Institute: How workflows have evolved in the past five years to address our varied needs: iPres 2018 - Boston"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Laura \",\"lastname\":\"Schroffel\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"2\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Teresa \",\"lastname\":\"Soleau \"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"1\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Lorain \",\"lastname\":\"Wang\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2019-01-04T15:55:01.873Z"], "_version_": 1761123781454069760, "ispartof": ["o:168770", "o:424738", "o:988723"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "The evolution of digital preservation at the Getty Research Institute: How workflows have evolved in the past five years to address our varied needs: iPres 2018 - Boston", "sort_dc_title": "The evolution of digital preservation at the Getty Research Institute: How workflows have evolved in the past five years to address our varied needs: iPres 2018 - Boston", "tsize": [55263.0], "tmodified": ["2019-01-04T16:05:53.736Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:988723", "__source_name": "iPRES", "__year": 2018}

We focus on the collections within Archive-It, a subscription service started by the Internet Archive in 2005 for the purpose of allowing organizations to create their own collections of archived web pages, or mementos.

We argue that both kinds of identifiers are needed and present the framework for intrinsic persistent identifiers that we have adopted in Software Heritage for preserving billions of software artifacts.\""], "dc_format": ["application/pdf"], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.923616", "doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/KDE56", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:923616"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY 4.0 International", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"], "dc_subject_eng": ["iPres 2018, Boston ", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2018 (001013)"], "keyword_suggest": ["iPres 2018, Boston ", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2018 (001013)"], "dc_title": ["Identifiers for Digital Objects: The case of software source code preservation: iPres 2018 - Boston"], "dc_title_eng": ["Identifiers for Digital Objects: The case of software source code preservation: iPres 2018 - Boston"], "dc_type_eng": ["Text"], "modified": "2019-01-04T16:15:58.749Z", "owner": "ipresu18", "pid": "o:923616", "resourcetype": "text", "size": 714074.0, "title_suggest": ["Identifiers for Digital Objects: The case of software source code preservation: iPres 2018 - Boston", "Identifiers for Digital Objects: The case of software source code preservation: iPres 2018 - Boston"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Roberto \",\"lastname\":\"Di Cosmo\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"1\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Morane \",\"lastname\":\"Gruenpeter\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"2\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Stefano \",\"lastname\":\"Zacchiroli\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2019-01-04T16:10:18.425Z"], "_version_": 1761123783793442816, "ispartof": ["o:168770", "o:424738", "o:988723"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "Identifiers for Digital Objects: The case of software source code preservation: iPres 2018 - Boston", "sort_dc_title": "Identifiers for Digital Objects: The case of software source code preservation: iPres 2018 - Boston", "tsize": [714074.0], "tmodified": ["2019-01-04T16:15:58.749Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:988723", "__source_name": "iPRES", "__year": 2018}

It is part of the PLANETS functional model which is an elaboration of the OAIS function Preservation Planning. The PLANETS functional model describes the functions and processes of a preservation planning component of a digital repository. It has three important preservation functions: watch, planning and action.

Preservation Watch will be included in the next revision of the OAIS standard.\nPreservation Watch has already partly been implemented at NaNeth. In 2018, however, we will fully implement an enhanced preservation watch in all departments of the organization: a 'horizontal' sustainable accessibility plan that is model-based, process-based and based on international standards and community best practices. The core of this plan is the structured monitoring of our own and external environment. For instance, the Collections department will monitor the state of the digital archives we keep in our repository, Public Services will monitor the needs of our user communities, Account Management will monitor developments within the ministerial departments whose archives in time will be transferred to us. The results of all these monitoring activities, under the coordination of preservation specialists, will be analysed for risks and opportunities in regular cycles. This will enable us to intervene in good time if the sustainable accessibility of information objects is threatened. We will also enlarge the model by adding the other OAIS functions (besides Planning): Creation, (pre)Ingest, Archival Storage, Data Management and Access. In this way we will cover the complete lifecycle of information objects, from creation to access. Eventually, we foresee a Preservation Watch on a national scale, under the umbrella of the Digital Heritage Network (DHN).
