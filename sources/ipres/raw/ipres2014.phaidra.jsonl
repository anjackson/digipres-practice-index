Furthermore, Law is becoming an essential application domain for technology developments. In case copyright protected data has to be digitally preserved, every process of a digital preservation system may violate this right, when the rightholder who has the exclusive rights did not grant the relevant rights of use. This paper shows a Legal Ontology that provides a hierarchical overview of how legal constraints and obligations (e.g. IP rights and licensing issues) could be implemented in an automated process of a DP system. In simply terms, difficulties with legal taxonomies may arises when the creators and the users don\u2019t share the same perspective. This would be the case when the creators of the taxonomy are lawyers and the users not. Legal taxonomies for digital preservation can be represented with ontologies which are an explicit account of a shared understanding in any domain. Through the use of ontologies the communication can be improved, which, in turn, can give rise to greater reuse, sharing, transparency, and interoperability. Every DP activity must ensure the authenticity and legitimacy of the performed actions and processes. Hence to validate the correctness of our legal ontology we used a set of competency questions defined in a specific case study. The goal is to obtain a clearer taxonomical view of the necessary legal knowledge that will address the concerns of industrial use-case DP stakeholders.

We address how the project consortium, comprising six academic institutions, integrates with existing partner repositories and how the Digital Repository of Ireland tackles issues of repository federation in terms of storage, deposit and the legal frameworks associated with these activities. \n "], "dc_format": ["application/pdf"], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.378124", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:378124"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/at/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/at/"], "dc_source": ["Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Digital Preservation, 244-248 (2014-12)"], "dc_subject_eng": ["iPRES 2014, Requirements, policy, storage, deposit, user roles, use case, legal frameworks"], "keyword_suggest": ["iPRES 2014, Requirements, policy, storage, deposit, user roles, use case, legal frameworks"], "dc_title": ["The process of building a national trusted digital repository: solving the federation problem: Paper - iPRES 2014 - Melbourne"], "dc_title_eng": ["The process of building a national trusted digital repository: solving the federation problem: Paper - iPRES 2014 - Melbourne"], "dc_type_eng": ["conference Object"], "modified": "2017-03-01T15:02:09.920Z", "object_type_id": ["http://phaidra.univie.ac.at/XML/metadata/lom/V1.0/organization/voc_17/1556237"], "owner": "pearsond32", "pid": "o:378124", "resourcetype": "text", "schema_pageend": ["248"], "schema_pagestart": ["244"], "size": 57999.0, "title_suggest": ["The process of building a national trusted digital repository: solving the federation problem: Paper - iPRES 2014 - Melbourne", "The process of building a national trusted digital repository: solving the federation problem: Paper - iPRES 2014 - Melbourne"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"date\":\"2015-01-20\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Sharon\",\"lastname\":\"Webb\",\"title1\":\"S\"},{\"data_order\":\"1\",\"firstname\":\"Aileen\",\"lastname\":\"O\u2019Carroll\",\"title1\":\"A\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2015-01-21T03:41:38.459Z"], "_version_": 1761121735751499776, "ispartof": ["o:378735"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "The process of building a national trusted digital repository: solving the federation problem: Paper - iPRES 2014 - Melbourne", "sort_dc_title": "The process of building a national trusted digital repository: solving the federation problem: Paper - iPRES 2014 - Melbourne", "tsize": [57999.0], "tmodified": ["2017-03-01T15:02:09.920Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:378735", "__source_name": "iPRES", "__year": 2014}

It is argued that the OO-IO model contributes a necessary extension to the literature of the digital preservation community to address the analysis and audit necessary for distributed digital preservation. \n"], "dc_format": ["application/pdf"], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.378118", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:378118"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/at/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/at/"], "dc_source": ["Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Digital Preservation, 209-218 (2014-12)"], "dc_subject_eng": ["iPRES 2014, OAIS Reference Model, Distributed Digital Preservation, Standards, Audits, Analysis, Collaboration"], "keyword_suggest": ["iPRES 2014, OAIS Reference Model, Distributed Digital Preservation, Standards, Audits, Analysis, Collaboration"], "dc_title": ["Supporting the Analysis and Audit of Collaborative OAIS\u2019s Using an Outer OAIS-Inner OAIS (OO-IO) Model: Paper - iPRES 2014 - Melbourne"], "dc_title_eng": ["Supporting the Analysis and Audit of Collaborative OAIS\u2019s Using an Outer OAIS-Inner OAIS (OO-IO) Model: Paper - iPRES 2014 - Melbourne"], "dc_type_eng": ["conference Object"], "modified": "2017-03-01T15:02:34.457Z", "object_type_id": ["http://phaidra.univie.ac.at/XML/metadata/lom/V1.0/organization/voc_17/1556237"], "owner": "pearsond32", "pid": "o:378118", "resourcetype": "text", "schema_pageend": ["218"], "schema_pagestart": ["209"], "size": 607851.0, "title_suggest": ["Supporting the Analysis and Audit of Collaborative OAIS\u2019s Using an Outer OAIS-Inner OAIS (OO-IO) Model: Paper - iPRES 2014 - Melbourne", "Supporting the Analysis and Audit of Collaborative OAIS\u2019s Using an Outer OAIS-Inner OAIS (OO-IO) Model: Paper - iPRES 2014 - Melbourne"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"date\":\"2015-01-20\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Eld\",\"lastname\":\"Zierau\",\"title1\":\"E\"},{\"data_order\":\"1\",\"firstname\":\"Nancy\",\"lastname\":\"McGovern\",\"title1\":\"N\",\"title2\":\"Y\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2015-01-21T03:03:56.345Z"], "_version_": 1761121735378206720, "ispartof": ["o:378735"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "Supporting the Analysis and Audit of Collaborative OAIS\u2019s Using an Outer OAIS-Inner OAIS (OO-IO) Model: Paper - iPRES 2014 - Melbourne", "sort_dc_title": "Supporting the Analysis and Audit of Collaborative OAIS\u2019s Using an Outer OAIS-Inner OAIS (OO-IO) Model: Paper - iPRES 2014 - Melbourne", "tsize": [607851.0], "tmodified": ["2017-03-01T15:02:34.457Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:378735", "__source_name": "iPRES", "__year": 2014}

Its graph data model innovates in the sense that it allows domain-specific lightweight ontologies to be used in resource description, acting as a staging area for later deposit in long-term preservation solutions. \n\n "], "dc_format": ["application/pdf"], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.378115", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:378115"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/at/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/at/"], "dc_source": ["Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Digital Preservation, 189-193 (2014-12)"], "dc_subject_eng": ["iPRES 2014, Research data management, data curation, ontologies, data repositories, Dendro"], "keyword_suggest": ["iPRES 2014, Research data management, data curation, ontologies, data repositories, Dendro"], "dc_title": ["The Dendro research data management platform: Applying ontologies to long-term preservation in a collaborative environment: Paper - iPRES 2014 - Melbourne"], "dc_title_eng": ["The Dendro research data management platform: Applying ontologies to long-term preservation in a collaborative environment: Paper - iPRES 2014 - Melbourne"], "dc_type_eng": ["conference Object"], "modified": "2017-03-01T15:02:46.755Z", "object_type_id": ["http://phaidra.univie.ac.at/XML/metadata/lom/V1.0/organization/voc_17/1556237"], "owner": "pearsond32", "pid": "o:378115", "resourcetype": "text", "schema_pageend": ["193"], "schema_pagestart": ["189"], "size": 602422.0, "title_suggest": ["The Dendro research data management platform: Applying ontologies to long-term preservation in a collaborative environment: Paper - iPRES 2014 - Melbourne", "The Dendro research data management platform: Applying ontologies to long-term preservation in a collaborative environment: Paper - iPRES 2014 - Melbourne"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"date\":\"2015-01-20\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Jo\u00e3o\",\"lastname\":\"da Silva\",\"title1\":\"J\",\"title2\":\"R\"},{\"data_order\":\"1\",\"firstname\":\"Jo\u00e3o\",\"lastname\":\"Castro\",\"title1\":\"J\",\"title2\":\"A\"},{\"data_order\":\"2\",\"firstname\":\"Cristina\",\"lastname\":\"Ribeiro\",\"title1\":\"C\"},{\"data_order\":\"3\",\"firstname\":\"Jo\u00e3o\",\"lastname\":\"Lopes\",\"title1\":\"J\",\"title2\":\"C\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2015-01-21T02:44:19.494Z"], "_version_": 1761121737108357120, "ispartof": ["o:378735"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "The Dendro research data management platform: Applying ontologies to long-term preservation in a collaborative environment: Paper - iPRES 2014 - Melbourne", "sort_dc_title": "The Dendro research data management platform: Applying ontologies to long-term preservation in a collaborative environment: Paper - iPRES 2014 - Melbourne", "tsize": [602422.0], "tmodified": ["2017-03-01T15:02:46.755Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:378735", "__source_name": "iPRES", "__year": 2014}
