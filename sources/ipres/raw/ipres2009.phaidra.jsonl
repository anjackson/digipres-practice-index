Current solutions are commonly based on typical web archiving activities, whereby a crawler is configured to harvest a copy of the blog and return the copy to a web archive. Yet this is not the only solution, nor is it always the most appropriate. We propose that in some cases, an approach building on the functionality provided by web feeds offers more potential. This paper describes research to develop such an approach, suitable for organisations of varying size and which can be implemented with relatively little resource and technical know-how: the ArchivePress project."], "dc_format": ["application/pdf"], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.294013", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294013"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY-SA 3.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/at/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY-SA 3.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/at/"], "dc_subject_eng": ["iPRES, San Francisco", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2009 (001004)"], "keyword_suggest": ["iPRES, San Francisco", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2009 (001004)"], "dc_title": ["ArchivePress: A Really Simple Solution to Archiving Blog Content: Paper - iPRES 2009 - San Francisco"], "dc_title_eng": ["ArchivePress: A Really Simple Solution to Archiving Blog Content: Paper - iPRES 2009 - San Francisco"], "dc_type_eng": ["Text"], "modified": "2017-03-02T02:51:42.435Z", "owner": "kellerc2", "pid": "o:294013", "resourcetype": "text", "size": 991675.0, "title_suggest": ["ArchivePress: A Really Simple Solution to Archiving Blog Content: Paper - iPRES 2009 - San Francisco", "ArchivePress: A Really Simple Solution to Archiving Blog Content: Paper - iPRES 2009 - San Francisco"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Maureen\",\"lastname\":\"Pennock\"},{\"data_order\":\"1\",\"firstname\":\"Richard\",\"lastname\":\"Davis\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2013-06-19T07:46:09.019Z"], "_version_": 1761117150306631680, "ispartof": ["o:168770", "o:294045", "o:424738"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "ArchivePress: A Really Simple Solution to Archiving Blog Content: Paper - iPRES 2009 - San Francisco", "sort_dc_title": "ArchivePress: A Really Simple Solution to Archiving Blog Content: Paper - iPRES 2009 - San Francisco", "tsize": [991675.0], "tmodified": ["2017-03-02T02:51:42.435Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:294045", "__source_name": "ipres2009", "__year": 2009}

One of the fundamental design questions for digital repositories is how to break down the services and resources: who will have responsibility, where they will reside, and how they will interact. There is no single, optimal answer to this question. The most appropriate arrangement depends on many factors that vary across repository contexts and are very likely to change over time. This paper reports on our investigation and testing of various repository \"slicing and dicing\" scenarios, their potential benefits, and implications for implementation, administration, and service offerings.
