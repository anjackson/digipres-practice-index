Organizations are struggling with the challenge of monitoring the formats in their SRB collections and providing suitable migration or emulation services as required. Automated methods are required that notify collections managers of objects that are at risk and that provide solutions to ensure long term access. The problem is exacerbated by the often proprietary and highly eclectic range of formats employed by scientific disciplines \u2013 many of which are too uncommon to be considered by existing national digital preservation initiatives. This paper describes our test bed implementation of a set of preservation services (obsolescence detection, notification and migration) over a heterogeneous distributed collection of objects, stored in SRB. It also provides an evaluation of the performance and usability of the PresSRB system, within the context of an environmental case study."], "dc_format": ["application/pdf"], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.294150", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294150"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY-SA 3.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/at/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY-SA 3.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/at/"], "dc_subject_eng": ["iPRES, London", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2008 (001003)"], "keyword_suggest": ["iPRES, London", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2008 (001003)"], "dc_title": ["Implementing Preservation Services over the Storage Resource Broker: Paper - iPRES 2008 - London"], "dc_title_eng": ["Implementing Preservation Services over the Storage Resource Broker: Paper - iPRES 2008 - London"], "dc_type_eng": ["Text"], "modified": "2017-03-02T02:43:38.628Z", "owner": "kellerc2", "pid": "o:294150", "resourcetype": "text", "size": 103393.0, "title_suggest": ["Implementing Preservation Services over the Storage Resource Broker: Paper - iPRES 2008 - London", "Implementing Preservation Services over the Storage Resource Broker: Paper - iPRES 2008 - London"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Douglas\",\"lastname\":\"Kosovic\"},{\"data_order\":\"1\",\"firstname\":\"Jane\",\"lastname\":\"Hunter\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2013-06-24T09:33:15.578Z"], "_version_": 1761117099960303616, "ispartof": ["o:168770", "o:294193", "o:424738"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "Implementing Preservation Services over the Storage Resource Broker: Paper - iPRES 2008 - London", "sort_dc_title": "Implementing Preservation Services over the Storage Resource Broker: Paper - iPRES 2008 - London", "tsize": [103393.0], "tmodified": ["2017-03-02T02:43:38.628Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:294193", "__source_name": "ipres2008", "__year": 2008}

Many variants of the Linux operating system and Solaris are available with support on a fee base.\nThe Hierarchical Storage System, or HSM, is a key software element of the archive. The HSM provides one of the key components that contributes to reliability by through data integrity checks and automated file migration. The HSM provides the ability to automate making multiples copies of files, auditing files for errors based on checksum, rejecting bad copies of files and making new copies based on the results of those audits. The HSM also provides the ability to read in an older file format and write-out a new file format thus migrating the format and application information required to ensure archival integrity of the stored content.

Files are seamlessly and transparently available to other services. SAM software creates virtually limitless capacity. Its scalability allows for continual growth throughout the archive with support for all data types. The policy based SAM software stores and manages data for compliance and non-compliance archives using a tiered storage approach with integrated disk and tape into a seamless storage solution, SAM software simplifies the archive storage. Allows you to automate data management policies based on file attributes. You can manage data according to the storage and access requirements of each user on the system and decide how data is grouped, copied, and accessed based on the needs of the application and the users. Helps you maximize return on investments by storing data on the media type appropriate for the life cycle of the data and simplifying system administration.\nSun Open Storage solutions provide the systems built with an open architecture using industry-standard hardware and opensource software. This open architecture allows the most flexible selection of the hardware and software components to best meet storage requirements. In a closed storage environment, all the components of a closed system must come from the vendor. Customers are locked into buying disk drives, controllers, and proprietary software features from a single vendor at premium prices and typically cannot add their own drives or software to improve functionality or reduce the cost of the closed system. Long term preservation is directly dependant on the long term viability of the software components.

Files are seamlessly and transparently available to other services. SAM software creates virtually limitless capacity. Its scalability allows for continual growth throughout the archive with support for all data types. The policy based SAM software stores and manages data for compliance and non-compliance archives using a tiered storage approach with integrated disk and tape into a seamless storage solution, SAM software simplifies the archive storage. Allows you to automate data management policies based on file attributes. You can manage data according to the storage and access requirements of each user on the system and decide how data is grouped, copied, and accessed based on the needs of the application and the users. Helps you maximize return on investments by storing data on the media type appropriate for the life cycle of the data and simplifying system administration.\nSun Open Storage solutions provide the systems built with an open architecture using industry-standard hardware and opensource software. This open architecture allows the most flexible selection of the hardware and software components to best meet storage requirements. In a closed storage environment, all the components of a closed system must come from the vendor. Customers are locked into buying disk drives, controllers, and proprietary software features from a single vendor at premium prices and typically cannot add their own drives or software to improve functionality or reduce the cost of the closed system. Long term preservation is directly dependant on the long term viability of the software components. Open source solutions offer the most viable long term option with open access and community based development and support."], "tcreated": ["2013-06-24T09:15:36.746Z"], "_version_": 1761117099371003904, "ispartof": ["o:168770", "o:294193", "o:424738"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "Repository and Preservation Storage Architecture: Paper - iPRES 2008 - London", "sort_dc_title": "Repository and Preservation Storage Architecture: Paper - iPRES 2008 - London", "tsize": [201450.0], "tmodified": ["2017-03-02T02:43:46.812Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:294193", "__source_name": "ipres2008", "__year": 2008}
